This is an international auxiliary language I made to fill the hole
in my heart that was left by Pandunia.  please don't actually learn
it.

This is the Universal Human Lexicon (*Putong Insan Loga-jama* or *PIL*).
The PIL is a simplified mode of communication designed to convey announcements and official communications
in a way that is easy to understand for speakers of all languages.
It is an alternative to posting sinage and publishing documents in a small number of national languages
that only some people can understand.
Because PIL is so simple, it can be learned much more quickly than a natural language.
