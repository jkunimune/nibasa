This is an international auxiliary language I made to fill the hole
in my heart that was left by Pandunia.  please don't actually learn
it.

Actually, think of it less as an international auxiliary language
and more as an international glossary with a bare-bones set of
grammatical particles for organizing words and phrases into
complete ideas.  yeah.
you can use it for signage and announcements in places where
a lingua franca is not widespread enuff or is undesirable.
