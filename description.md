# How does it work?

## Spelling and pronunciation

USL words are written using a simplified form of the Latin alphabet.
The letters *q* and *x* are not used in basic USL words.
This is to avoid confusion and ease the learning for people not familiar with the Latin alphabet.

When USL words are pronounced out loud, they should always be pronounced phonetically.
There are no silent letters, and each letter is only pronounced one way.

- "a" is always open as in "father".
- "c" sounds like the "ch" in "charlie".
- "e" is always short as in "echo".
- "g" is always hard as in "get".
- "i" always sounds like the "i" in "machine".
- "o" always sounds like the "o" in "force".
- "r" may be smooth as it is in English or trilled as it is in Spanish or Hindi. It is never silent.
- "s" is always soft as in "thesis"
- "u" always sounds like the "oo" in "goose".
- "y" is always a consonant as in "yankey". It is never a vowel.
