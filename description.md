# phonology

the phonology will be largely the same as in Pandunia 2.0 but for some modifications.

- I'm allowing all consonants besides voiced obstruents at the end of a syllable.
- I'm forbidding **eu** and replacing all instances with **yu** or **eo**.
- I'm allowing the clusters **kn** and **gn** for **tekni**, **magnete**, and **jagna**.
- I'm merging **s** with **sh** and **z** with **j**, and changing **ch** to **c**.  this removes the need for digraphs. (or maybe I should lean into digraphs and spell **j** as **zh** (or just do the normal thing and merge sh~ch into ⟨c⟩))
- I'm calling **ng** a consonant.

|           | labial  | coronal    | palatal           | dorsal | 
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| nasal     | m       |            |                   | ng     |
| stop      | p b     | t d        | c (t͡ʃ~ʃ) j (d͡ʒ~ʒ) | k g    |
| fricative | f       | s z (z~d͡z) |                   | h      |
| glide     | v (w~v) | l r (r~ɹ)  | y (j)             |        |

|       | front | back |

| close | i     | u    |
| mid   | e     | o    |
| open  | a     |      |

## phonotactics

a syllable is CVC or PLVC.  restrictions apply to medial CC clusters:
- they must differ in manner of articulation (no fricative+fricative, stop+stop, nasal+nasal, or liquid+liquid).
<!-- - if the first is a stop, they must differ in place of articulation (or maybe not, I haven't decided) -->
- if both are obstruents, they must agree in voicing.

restrictions also apply to the coda consonant.
- it must not be a voiced obstruent
- it must not be a semivowel

also, "y" may not be adjacent to "i", nor "v" adjacent to "u".
all vowel sequences are allowd, but "ei" and "ou" may only be at the end of a word, and "eu" is actually forbidden.
an open or mid vowel followd by a close vowel should ideally be pronounced as a diphthong.
since they will naturally
a syllable can't start with "tl" or "dl".

obviously, any proper name has laxer rules.  it has no phonotactic constraints, including bonus characters.
but semivowels should still be spelld via normal conventions if the source language doesn't use the latin alphabet

Bonus characters: ts (t͡s), tl (t͡ɬ), dl (d͡ɮ), gh (ɣ), th (θ), dh (ð), ' (ʔ), kc (k͡ǀ), gc (ɡ͡ǀ), kx (k͡ǁ), gx (ɡ͡ǁ), kq (k͡ǃ), gq (ɡ͡ǃ), á, é, í, ó, ú (stress)

## stress

Stress falls on the last heavy syllable if such a syllable exists.
Otherwise, it falls on the penultimate syllable?

/dú.ní.a/
/ka.rí.bu/
/ba.dán/
/pu.táu̯/

## spelling conventions

The following tables describe the standard transcription style of Nibasa.
This is how new words should be respelld when added to the dictionary.
Note that these rules are neither fast nor hard,
and there may be variations when a word comes from a different source,
or from a combination of several.

### Latin

| zi (fon) | tarjum | misal |
|----------|--------|-------|
| c (hard)| k    | |
| c (soft)| s    | |
| ch (kʰ) | k    | |
| g (hard)| g    | |
| g (soft)| j    | |
| j (j)   | j    | |
| ph (pʰ) | f    | |
| qu (kʷ) | ku?  | |
| s (s)   | s    | |

### English

Note that these rules only apply for words that originate from English.
Most words shared between Nibasa and English originally come from Latin, which has its rules above.

### Chinese

This table is based on Mandarin, since it's by far the most spoken chinese language,
but the transcription style is based on a consideration of all chinese and Chinese-derived languages.
That, in addition to a desire to maintain spelling, is why retroflex consonants are transcribed as alveolar,
and tenuis occlusive obstruents are transcribed as voiced.
For palatal consonants and final nasals, the spelling depends on the conservative pronunciation,
which is however it's pronounced in Cantonese.

Note that this table does not include stop codas, which are maintained from Old Chinese.

# vocabulary

the vocabulary will be very similar to that of Pandunia 2.0, but I want to simplify it somewhat.

- merge **poli** with **multi** and **ba**
- merge **siti** with **nagra**
- merge **ama** with **fili**
- merge **paku** with **mus**
- merge **di** with **su**
- merge **mas** with **masim** and **min** with **minim** (the number of points of comparison is apparent without the lexical distinction)
- merge **bio** with **ziva**
- merge **ganja** with **hashish**
- merge **kek** and **klien**
- use **kastre** instead of **burge**?
- use **tai** and **bas no** for "too much; over" and "too little; under" (use **drama meza** to mean "stage")
- use **di bi ze** and **di yang na** for "than" and "as" (**bi** is a new content word meaning "comparison")
- use **karibu sha** instead of **sun**
- use **unike** instead of **un di**
- use **luku** instead of **verde**
- use **ba** instead of **pa**
- use **nesia** instead of **nesi** (and thus **Indonesia** and **Mikronesia**)
- use **Zong Desha** instead of **Zongoku**
- use **kauchuk** instead of **gomu**
- use **junbei** instead of **redi**
- use **tuka** instead of **insulte** (swa:tukano, lin:kotuka, sho:tuka, zul:-thuka, kin:gutuka, nya:-tukwana)
- use **jete** instead of **lanse**, and use **lansa** for "spear"
- use **kon mal** instead of **komun**
- use **avaria** instead of **avar**
- use **krede** instead of **sina**
- use **debe** instead of **deve**
- use **vakat** instead of **zaman** or **sata**
- use **line** instead of **lin** (use **lin** to mean "neighbor")
- use **tabi** as a suffix
- use **pul** and **sam** as a suffix instead of **di**
- use **suki** instead of **suka**
- use **nan** instead of **man**
- fix **sau**, **sanghai**, **sifu**, (**sindau**), (**sim**), **sipi**, (**sin**), **suli**, **lensi**, **si**, **siti**, and **jensem**

ideas from Pandunia 3:
- almas -> adamas

ideas from Globasa:
form adjectives using -pul and -sam, rather than -di or -iki, which have always been quite ambiguous.  in general, the suffixing should always be semantically specific.
merge **jen** and **ja**
"semi" for "half"?
"total" for "absolute"?

ideas from Lidepla:

in addition, the following spelling conventions will be changed.

- no more tone-marking vowels.  checkd chinese syllables will end in no vowel.
- all proper names of inanimate things will be followed by a mandatory suffix.  so "France" will always be **franse desa**.

## Proper names

Proper names of countries are re-spelled in Nibasa's alphabet.
Personal names and city names will inevitably be spelled irregularly in many circumstances.
Proper names have access to the bonus letters.
They must be followd by a common noun to identify them (e.g. Franse desa, Suahili basa, Smith jen, Jorje raja, Zamenhof dotor)

# grammar

the grammar will be isolating and use SOV word order, with postpositions to mark nouns instead of articles or word endings.  two new postpositions, **ga** and **ro**, will be introduced to mark the subject and direct object, respectively.  **do** will be expanded to mark the indirect object, as well as adverbs.  by making the grammar entirely left-branching, we reduce the number of types of phrase, and the number of structures needed to combine them, thus greatly reducing the number of function words.  specifically,

- there is no definite article **la** (all nouns are markd by postpositions (tho maybe I should use **al** for this anyway)).
- there is no relative pronoun **jo** or content clause marker **ki** (both are indicated by **di**).
- there is no possessive preposition **da** (only the postposition **di** is needed).
- there is no passive auxiliary **be** (the subject and object are marked with postpositions, so they can be swapd around freely).

in addition, many words that were necessarily function words in Pandunia 2.0 are effectively content words in Nibasa, so you don't need to know their part of speech to parse a sentence.  this includes
- pronouns **mi**, **tu**, and **ye**, which are just normal nouns (**se** merges with **auto**)
- demonstratives **ni**, **go**, **yo**, and **ke**, and quantifiers **un**, **yo**, **eni**, **pan**, which are just adjectives that can also function as nouns (**poli** merges with **ba**)
- auxiliary verbs **si**, **fa**, which are just normal verbs as well as common suffixes (**si** merges with **ta** and **fa** merges with **karma**).

the two main auxiliary verbs will be **ta** and **fa**.  **ta** means "to be", and is used to indicate states, existence, and the progressive aspect.  **fa** means "do", and is used to indicate changes of state, action, and the perfective aspect.

grammatical voice is usually simply implied.  however, there are a handful of suffixes that can indicate voice explicitly: **-fa** is causative, **-get** is passive, **auto-** is reflexive, and **unalo-** is reciprocal.

the three tenses will be **le** (past), **zai** (present), and **sha** (future).  these will most typically be used as adverbs, but can also go at the end of the main verb like **ti** and **fa**.  the suffix **le** in particular is useful for using verbs as adjectives.

the affirmative, negative, and interrogative particles "ya", "no", and "ke" can go before or after the verb.  before is more common.  same as the tense particles.  auxiliary verbs such as "abil" and "amir" must go after.

The basic sentence structures will look like this:

there is an N.
N ga ta.

N1 is N2.  
N1 ga N2 ta.

N1 has N2.  
N1 di N2 ga ta.

N1 V.  
N1 ga V.

N1 V N2.  
N1 ga N2 ro V.

Interrogatives are formed by placing "ke" rite before or after the verb.

## on verbs

in general, I beleve that descriptions like this are an unnecessary and inefficient way to learn a language.  however, since I know the language nerds here will be interested, here is a precise linguistic description of the aspect particles and thematic roles in Nibasa.

in Nibasa, there are a handful of postpositions that can be used to mark the arguments of a sentence.  when a verb is transitive, the agent is he subject (markd with **ga**), and the patient is the direct object (markd with **ro**).  for emotions like happiness and anger, the experiencer is the patient and the stimulus is the agent, tho note that opinions and senses like hatred and vision are not considerd emotions.

aside from subjects and direct objects, postpositions are fairly loose in Nibasa.  the intention is that speakers will use whatever postposition feels most natural to them, which will lead to a good deal of variation.  this is acceptable as long as it does not impact intelligibility.  some examples of common variations:

| english | bil sei 1 | bil sei 2 |
| go to school | darse kan ro gou | darse kan do gou |
| give it to me | mi na don | mi do don |
| explain it to me | mi na ming fa | mi do ming fa |
| near the city | siti di karibu | siti ze karibu |

in Nibasa, an unmarked verb is, depending on its semantics, either a state (such as **blu**, which means "to be blue"), a perfective action (like **yam**, which means "to eat"), or an ambiguous combination of the two (like **furi**, which means "to be angry" or "to anger").  "ta" can emphasize that a state is stative, or force an ambiguous verb to be unambiguously stative.  "fa" can emphasize that an action is perfective or force an ambiguous verb to be perfective.  thus, "furi ta" means "to be angry" and "furi fa" means "to anger".

"ta" can also be added to a semantic action, or to a verb phrase that already has "fa", to convert it to an imperfective action.  for example, "yam ta" means "to be eating", and "blu fa ta" means "to be turning blue".  analagously, "fa" can be added to a semantic state or to a verb phrase that already has "ta" to convert it to a perfective aspect, which corresponds to the causative incohative of the state.  so "blu fa" means "to turn blue" and "yam ta fa" means "to turn into something that is eating" ("ta fa" is not really useful in practice).

there also exist three tense suffixes.  the most useful by far is "le", as it changes an action into an ambiguous combination of stative (the result of the action) and perfective (the action, but in the past), which can again be enforced by adding "ta" or "fa".  "le ta" thus functions as the opposite of "fa" in certain situations.

these particles also interact with the transitivity of verbs.  a state is always intransitive, and its one argument may only be markd by "ga".  a perfective action or an imperfective action, is ambitransitive.  if it has two arguments, "ga" marks the agent and "ro" marks the patient.  if it has one argument markd by "ro", it is the patient.  if it has one argument markd by "ga", it could be the agent or the patient -- whichever is more likely given the semantics of the verb.  note that this makes it impossible to include an agent without including a patient; the phrase "sei ro" is typically inserted when the patient is unknown or unimportant.

| loga | ding mana | varati | use |
|------|-----------|--------|-----|
| ta   | state, -ity   | imperfective | turns a perfective action into an imperfective action or adds emphasis to a state |
| fa   | action, -tion | perfective   | turns a state into an incohative action or adds emphasis to a perfective action |
| le   | done          | past/perfect |turns a state into an experiential state or a perfective action into its resulting state
| zai  | current       | present      | moves the reference time to the present moment |
| ???  | future        | future       | turns a state into a prospective state or perfective action into a prospective action |

this assumes that every verb is semantically either a state (blue), a perfective action (eat), or an ambiguous combination of the two (anger).

there is no passivizer in Nibasa.  if it turns out to be necessary, I will introduce one -- probably "se", or maybe "get".
but for now, I think reversing the order of the arguments should accomplish the same thing more simply.
