# How does it work?

# phonology

common PIL roots are composed of eighteen distinct consonants and five vowels.

|           | labial   | coronal    | palatal            | dorsal   | 
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------------|----------|
| nasal     | m        | n          |                    | ng (ŋ)   |
| stop      | p (pʰ) b | t (tʰ) d   | c (t͡ʃʰ~ʃ) j (d͡ʒ~ʒ) | k (kʰ) g |
| fricative | f        | s z (z~d͡z) |                    | h (x~h)  |
| glide     | v (w~v)  | l r (r~ɹ)  | y (j)              |          |

|       | front | back |
|-------|-------|------|
| close | i     | u    |
| mid   | e     | o    |
| open  | a     |      |

there exist several additional letters that are only used in proper names:
- “gh” for the voiced dorsal fricative (ɣ\~ʁ)
- “th” and “dh” for the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives (θ and ð)
- “kc” and “gc” for the voiceless and voiced laminal clicks (k͡|\~k͡ǂ and ɡ͡|\~ɡ͡ǂ)
- “kq” and “gq” for the voiceless and voiced postalveolar clicks (k͡! and ɡ͡!)
- “kx” and “gx” for the voiceless and voiced lateral clicks (k͡ǁ and ɡ͡ǁ)
- "’" for the glottal stop (ʔ), for ejective stops (kʼ), and to separate digraphs (e.g. n.ɡ, t.h)
- "á", "é", "í", "ó", and "ú" for irregular stress

## phonotactics

in general, there are three firm rules that are never violated for any PIL word:
- the nucleus of every syllable is a vowel, or a diphthong composed of an open or mid vowel followed by a close vowel.
- the semivowels “y” and “v” are always followed by a vowel.
- the letter “y” is never adjacent to “i”, and “v” is never adjacent to “u”.
- adjacent identical letters are forbidden.

there are also several stricter rules that apply to common PIL roots (as opposed to proper names).
- the onset of every syllable is either a single consonant or a stop followed by a liquid.
- the coda of a syllable is a single consonant.
- adjacent obstruents always agree in voicing
- nasal consonants always agree with the following consonant when the following consonant is an occlusive.
- stops always differ in place of articulation from the following consonant unless the following consonant is “r”.
- semivowels never appear adjacent to a consonant.
- a word never ends with a voiced obstruent.
- the vowel sequences “ei” and “ou” may only be at the end of a word, and “eu” is forbidden in all positions.
- a root contains no more than three syllables.

while there is no minimum length for common roots,
one- and two-letter roots are typically reserved for grammatical particles and common suffixes.

## stress

A PIL word should be pronounced with one syllable for each vowel or closed diphthong “ai”, “au”, “oi”, “ei”, or “ou”.
Stress falls before the last consonant or closed diphthong.

## spelling conventions

The following tables describe the standard transcription style of Nibasa.
This is how new words should be respelld when added to the dictionary.
Note that these rules are neither fast nor hard,
and there may be variations when a word comes from a different source,
or from a combination of several.

### Latin

\* Nouns describing people and adjectives all take “-e” instead of “-a” or “-o”.
\*\* The names of chemical elements for which the “-ium” is universal are suffixed with the dedicated morpheme “ium”.
\*\*\* Feminine or Greek “-i” is expanded to “-ia” for words representing places that would otherwise be two syllables.

words should be adapted as whatever part of speech is most semantically appropriate.
when multiple parts of speech would be reasonable, nouns should be preferred, followed by verbs, then adjectives.
prefixing forms should only be used if all other forms are now rare.

Generally, “c” is soft when followed by “i”, “e”, or “y” and hard otherwise.
However, note that Nibasa treats “c” as hard if it is hard in Russian (as descendants of Greek "κ" usually are).

Generic suffixes may be omitted entirely if they have been lost in Spanish and Portuguese.


### English

Note that these rules only apply for words that originate from English.
Most words shared between Nibasa and English originally come from Latin, which has its rules above.

| ه (h)   | h    | |
| ح (ħ)   | h    | |
| ط (tˤ)  | t    | |

| ظ (zˤ)  | z    | |
| غ (ɣ)   | g    | |
| ء (ʔ)   | siro | amir |
| ة-(-at)   | a\* | |

\* a “t” is included in the transliterated word if it would otherwise only be two letters long (e.g. “sat”).

adjectives should be taken as masculine, unless doing so would cause the word to end with a semivowel or voiced obstruent.
the CaCiC(a) form should be preferred, followed by CaCaC(a), then CuCuC.
CaCC violates the phonotactics and may not be used.

The digraphs /aj/ and /aw/ are transcribed as “ej” and “ou” where permitted by the phonotactics, and “e” and “o” elsewhere.
Verbs and adverbs should be converted to adjectives or nouns before being transliterated.
Adjectives and nouns describing people are transcribed as feminine.

### Chinese

This table is based on Mandarin, since it's by far the most spoken chinese language,
but the transcription style is based on a consideration of all chinese and Chinese-derived languages.
That, in addition to a desire to maintain spelling, is why retroflex consonants are transcribed as alveolar,
and tenuis occlusive obstruents are transcribed as voiced.
For palatal consonants and final nasals, the spelling depends on the conservative pronunciation,
which is however it's pronounced in Cantonese.

Note that this table does not include stop codas, which are maintained from Old Chinese.

|---------|------|
| en (ən) | part   e  | part  e   | powder o  | o
| en (əm)
| ong (uŋ)| center u  | center u | species o  | species o

## capitalization

By convention, capital letters are used to mark proper nouns.
Common nouns should always start with lowercase letters, even at the beginning of a sentence.


# vocabulary

Nibasa words are chosen to maximize international recognizability.
Names of elements are always taken from Latin such that they correspond to the chemical symbol.
Names of living things with limited ranges are taken from a language spoken in the region where it is common.
Names of living things that exist across a large enough area are based on their scientific name,
unless the scientific name is obscure or another common name is particularly internationally recognizable.

PIL words should have meanings as close as possible to the natural words they are based on.
For example, even though the genus *Chrysanthemum* is native to China,
the Latin root “chrysanthema” is preferred over the Chinese root “菊” for its PIL name,
because “chrysanthema” specifically refers to *Chrysanthemum* while “菊” also refers to other plants in the family *Asteraceae*.
On the other hand, for the order *Hymenoptera*,
the Chinese root “蜂” is preferred over the Latin roots “apis” and “vespa”,
because “蜂” covers the full order while “apis” and “vespa” make a nonphyletic distinction.
<!-- TODO: ants make this a bad example -->

## word derivation

compound words are formed by connecting two existing words using a hyphen “-”.
A middle dot “·” is also acceptable depending on preference.
The first word modifies the meaninng of the second.

# grammar

The grammar of PUDUL is based on unchanging content words that can fill any part of speech.
For example, the word “ai” can mean "(n.) love", "(v.) to love", "(a.) loving; beloved", or "(av.) lovingly".
The context determines the word's part of speech.
Generally, nouns are followed by postpositions, verbs come at the ends of clauses,
adjectives come before nouns, and adverbs come before verbs.

Note in the above example that there are no true particilpse in PUDUL,
and accordingly no distinction between active or passive participles.
Most cases where the difference is important are satisfied by the suffixes
"-jen" ("-er"), "-cei" ("-thing"), "-fa" ("-ify"), and "-lio" ("-ed").
<!--TODO how awesome would it be to automatically link to those words in the dictionary-->

## phrases

Simple phrases in PUDUL are composed of simple sequences of content words.
The last word in a phrase is the head, and the others modify it.
When three content words appear in sequence, it is ambiguous whether the first one modifies the second modifier, or the head.
For example, the phrase "vere [daiji] dokumen" can mean “a truly important document”, or “a true, important document”.
The genitive particle “di” exists to clarify such ambiguities when they arise.
It separates a modifier from the word it modifies.
As such, it is never strictly necessary, but is useful for grouping words together.
For example, "vere [daiji] di dokumen" means “a truly important document”,
while "vere di [daiji] dokumen" means “a true, important document”.

There are two conjunctions:
- e (and)
- o (or)
They may connect any kinds of phrases, including clauses.

Noun phrases are not marked for number or definiteness by default.
Adjectives like “ta” (“some”), “go” (“that”), or “mi di” (“my”) may be used to explicitly express definiteness,
while adjectives like “un” (“one”), “du” (“two”), or “poli” (“many”) may be used to express number.
Pudul nouns do not have grammatical gender.

## clauses

A basic clause in PuDuL is composed of a series of postpositional phrases followed by a predicate.
There are six postpositions in PuDuL:
- ga (nominative)
- ro (accusative)
- li (dative, also marks adverbs when they do not precede the verb)
- ze (ablative)
- na (locative)
- e (instrumental)

These postpositional phrases may be in any order,
and any of them may be omitted if is unnecessary or implied, including the subject.
The postposition adjacent to the verb can also usually be omitted.
By convention, the “ro” phrase is usually placed last.

The predicate may be a verb, adjective, or noun.
While it is usually clear from semantics whether a content word at the end of the sentence is a verb or an adjective,
nouns can sometimes be ambiguous.
In that event, the suffix “ta”, which can be translated as “to be”, should be appended to the predicate.
Note that in this usage, “ta” is technically not a verb and thus should not take a direct object.

When a verb is used transitively, “ga” should mark the agent or the stimulus,
while “ro” should mark the patient or the experiencer.
When any verb is used without a “ro”, “ga” may mark either role.

Subordinate clauses are simply formed by using a clause as a noun phrase.
Similarly, relative clauses are formed by using a clause as an adjective.
The role of the head noun in the relative clause is encoded only with a gap
(the gap should be a missing postpositional phrase; hanging postpositions are not allowed in Pudul)
While not strictly required, a relative clause that contains postpositions
should almost always be followed by “di” to clarify the sentence structure.

## existential and possessive statements

Existential statements are formed with the predicate “ta”.

There is no PUDUL verb meaning “to have”.
Posession is indicated by combining the genitive particle “di” with the existential predicate “ta”.
For example, the sentence "I have a cat." is expressed as "mi di mau ga ta.".

## Sentence-level markings

Tense and aspect are usually either indicated with specific phrases like “pos den na” (“tomorrow”), or left unspecified.
The most common tense and aspect statements can be expressed with simple adverbs/auxiliaries.
The most common ones are:
- lio (past tense)
- zai (present tense)
- te (progressive aspect)
- fa (perfective aspect)
- ada (habitual aspect)

Mood and polarity are marked with particles immediately before the predicate.
The most common particles particles are:
- ke (interrogative)
- latif (polite imperative)
- neses (impolite imperative)
- ya (positive)
- no (negative)
All of these particles may also be placed before the predicate with no difference in meaning except “ke”,
which would be interpreted as a direct object.

Voice is not marked in Pudul.
A passive voice can be approximated by reversing the usual order of the “ga” phrase and “ro” phrase.
Reflexive and reciprocal voices should be explicitly described by inserting the phrase “auto ro” or “un alo ro”.
