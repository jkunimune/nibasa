# How does it work? (detailed version)

## spelling and pronunciation

common PIL roots are composed of eighteen distinct consonants and five vowels.
in this table, IPA is given in parentheses when it differs from the orthography, which is not in parentheses.

|           | labial     | coronal      | palatal | dorsal    | 
|-----------|------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| nasal     | m          | n            |         | ng (ŋ)    |
| stop      | p (pʰ) · b | t (tʰ) · d    | c (t͡ʃʰ)  | k (kʰ) · g |
| fricative | f          | s · z        |         | h         |
| glide     | v (ʋ)      | l · r (ɾ)    | y (j)   |           |

|       | front | back |
|-------|-------|------|
| close | i     | u    |
| mid   | e     | o    |
| open  | a     |      |

the five vowels can combine to form five diphthong:
- ai (ai̯)
- ao (au̯)
- ei (ei̯)
- ou (ou̯)
- oi (oi̯)

there exist several additional letters that are only used in proper names and culturally specific terms (like arts and dishes):
- “zh” for the voiced postalveolar/retroflex fricative/affricate (ʒ\~ʐ or d͡ʒ\~ɖ͡ʐ)
- “sh” for the voiceless postalveolar/retroflex fricative (ʃ\~ʂ)
- “gh” for the voiced dorsal fricative (ɣ\~ʁ)
- “th” and “dh” for the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives (θ and ð)
- “lh” for the voiceless lateral approximant or lateral fricative (l̥\~ɬ)
- “mh”, “nh”, “ngh”, and “rh” for voiceless sonorants (m̥, n̥, ŋ̊, and r̥\~ɹ̥)
- "ts" for the voiceless alveolar affricate (t͡s)
- “kc” and “gc” for the voiceless and voiced laminal clicks (k͡|\~k͡ǂ and ɡ͡|\~ɡ͡ǂ)
- “q” and “gq” for the voiceless and voiced postalveolar clicks (k͡! and ɡ͡!)
- “x” and “gx” for the voiceless and voiced lateral clicks (k͡ǁ and ɡ͡ǁ)
- “pc” and “bc” for the voiceless and voiced labial clicks (k͡ʘ and g͡ʘ)
- “’” for the glottal stop (ʔ), for ejective stops (kʼ), and to separate digraphs (e.g. _n’g_ or _t’h_)
- “eu” for the diphthong eu̯
- “á”, “é”, “í”, “ó”, and “ú” for irregular stress (these are often omitted after the first time a word is used, or not used at all in informal writing)

Because of the wide variety of backgrounds learners of PUDUL have, it is common for some letters' pronunciations to vary somewhat from person to person.
For example, many pronounce `h` as [x], `v` as [v] or [w], or `r` as [ɹ].
Because PUDUL has a relatively small number of phonemes, such variations can be tolerated without impacting the intelligibility of the speech as long as they are minor.

### phonotactics

in general, there are three firm rules that are never violated for any PIL word:
- the nucleus of every syllable is a vowel, or a diphthong composed of an open or mid vowel followed by a close vowel.
- the semivowels “y” and “v” are always followed by a vowel.
- adjacent identical consonants are forbidden.

there are also several stricter rules that apply to common PIL roots (as opposed to proper names, technical terms, or words specific to a particular culture).
- the onset of every syllable is either a single consonant or one of "pr", "tr", "kr", "pl", "kl", or "ny".
- the onset of a syllable is never "ng".
- the coda of a syllable is a single consonant.
- adjacent obstruents always agree in voicing.
- a word never ends with a voiced obstruent.
- nasal consonants always agree with the following consonant when the following consonant is an occlusive.
- the letters "s”, "z”, and "c” never occur next to each other.
- semivowels never appear adjacent to their corresponding vowel.
- rising vowel sequences are always broken up by semivowels except for the five digraphs.
- roots rarely contain more than three syllables.

while there is no minimum length for common roots,
one- and two-letter roots are typically reserved for grammatical particles and common suffixes.

### stress

A PIL word should be pronounced with one syllable for each vowel or diphthong.
Stress falls on the last syllable if it is closed, and on the penultimate syllable otherwise.

/gé.o/
/ha.lóu̯/
/kris.tál/
/du.ní.a/
/gu.rú.be/
/res.to.rán/

### capitalization

By convention, capital letters are used to mark proper names.
PIL roots always start with lowercase letters, even at the beginning of a sentence.


## vocabulary

Nibasa words are chosen to maximize international recognizability.
Names of elements are always taken from Latin such that they correspond to the chemical symbol.
Names of living things with limited ranges are taken from a language spoken in the region where it is common.
Names of living things that exist across a large enough area are based on their scientific name,
unless the scientific name is obscure or another common name is particularly internationally recognizable.

PIL words should have meanings as close as possible to the natural words they are based on.
For example, even though the genus *Chrysanthemum* is native to China,
the Latin root “chrysanthema” is preferred over the Chinese root “菊” for its PIL name,
because “chrysanthema” specifically refers to *Chrysanthemum* while “菊” also refers to other plants in the family *Asteraceae*.
On the other hand, for the order *Hymenoptera*,
the Chinese root “蜂” is preferred over the Latin roots “apis” and “vespa”,
because “蜂” covers the full order while “apis” and “vespa” make a nonphyletic distinction.
<!-- TODO: ants make this a bad example -->

### spelling conventions

The following tables describe the standard transcription style of Nibasa.
This is how new words should be respelld when added to the dictionary.
Note that these rules are neither fast nor hard,
and there may be variations when a word comes from a different source,
or from a combination of several.

#### Latin

Latin was the language of the Roman Empire, and its descendants are some of the most widely spoken languages in the world today.  Even European languages that aren't descended from it (especially English) have absorbed much of its lexicon due to its prominent role in the Scientific Revolution in Europe.  Because it had a relatively average phonology, it's relatively easy to fit its words into PUDUL.  Latin contains many ancient Greek borrowings, which do not fit quite so neatly, but most of them have Latinized pronunciations that serve as the basis for their PUDUL forms.

\* Nouns describing people and adjectives all take “-e” instead of “-a” or “-o”.
\*\* Masculine or neuter "-i” is expanded to "-iu” for the names of chemical elements.
\*\*\* Feminine or Greek “-i” is expanded to “-ia” for words representing places that would otherwise be two syllables.

words should be adapted as whatever part of speech is most semantically appropriate.
when multiple parts of speech would be reasonable, nouns should be preferred, followed by verbs, then adjectives.
prefixing forms should only be used if all other forms are now rare.

Generally, “c” is soft when followed by “i”, “e”, or “y” and hard otherwise.
However, note that Nibasa treats “c” as hard if it is hard in Russian (as descendants of Greek "κ” usually are).

Generic suffixes are omitted entirely if they have been lost in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and doing so does not violate the phonotactics.  Note that the suffix is not considered lost from English if there's still a silent "-e" (so "lake" is still _lako_, not _lak_).

Words recently loaned from Latin that retain their full Latinate suffix in modern languages, such as "virus", naturally also retain their full suffix in Nibasa.

#### English

English is currently the most widely spoken language in the world, serving as the unofficial language of science and business.  Accordingly, many of its words are used in every part of the world, and make excellent PUDUL words.  However, due to English's complex phonology, and especially its abundance of vowels, these words must be modified before being imported.  Some English words have large consonant clusters which make it impossible to fit them into PUDUL at all.

Note that these rules only apply for words that originate from English.
Most words shared between Nibasa and English originally come from Latin, which has its rules above.

#### Arabic

Arabic is spoken throughout the Arab world, and has also influenced the languages of south Asia, Indonesia, and eastern Africa due to the spread of Islam.  When Arabic roots are imported into PUDUL, their Modern Standard Arabic form is used.  Because Modern Standard Arabic has so many consonants, many of them must be adapted as shown in the below table.

| zi (fon) | tarcuma | misal |
|----------|--------|-------|
| ج (d͡ʒ)  | c    | |
| ه (h)   | h    | |
| ح (ħ)   | h    | |
| ط (tˤ)  | t    | |
| ع (ʕ)   | nulo | |
| ص (sˤ)  | s    | |
| ق (q)   | k    | kalam |
| ش (ʃ)   | s    | |
| ث (θ)   | s    | |
| خ (x)   | h    | |
| ذ (ð)   | z    | |
| ض (dˤ)  | d\*  | |
| ب (b)   | b\*  | |
| ﺪ (d)   | d\*  | |
| ظ (zˤ)  | z    | |
| غ (ɣ)   | g\*  | |
| ء (ʔ)   | nulo | amir |
| ة-(-at)   | a\*\* | |

\* voiced stops are transliterated as voiceless stops when at the end of the word.
\*\* a “t” is included in the transliterated word if it would otherwise only be two letters long (e.g. “sat”).

Arabic roots are taken in the form that is most internationally widespread; usually as CaCiC(a) adjectives or CaCaC(a) nouns.
adjectives are taken as masculine, unless doing so would cause the word to end with a semivowel or voiced obstruent.

The diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/ are transcribed as “ei” and “ou”.
Verbs and adverbs should generally be converted to adjectives or nouns, respectively before being transliterated.
Nouns of variable gender and adjectives are transcribed as masculine, unless doing so would violate the phonotactics.

#### Sanskrit

Sanskrit was once the Lingua Franca of the Indian subcontinent, and its words have spread far and wide due to the spread of Indian religions and spices.  The main challenges of importing them to PUDUL are the aspirated and retroflex consonants, which are converted to unaspirated and alveolar consonants, respectively.

| (bʰ)    | b    ||
| (p)     | p    ||

| (ɡʰ)    | g    ||
| (kʰ)     | h    ||
| (ʃ)     | s    ||

Schwas should usually be transcribed as "a”, but may be omitted to preserve stress.

#### Chinese

While what we now call "Chinese" is really a collection of closely related but distinct languages, each with many distinct dialects, in the middle ages there was a single Chinese language that exported many of its words to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.  These words changed drastically in each language they were used in – especially in the pronunciation of the palatal initials, stop codas, and tones – and as a result it is now hard to adapt them into PUDUL in a way that retains recognizability to all of these groups.  However, by primarily importing two-character compounds, it is possible to do so for some words.

This table is based on Mandarin, since it's by far the most spoken chinese language,
but the transcription style is based on a consideration of all chinese and Chinese-adjacent languages.
That, in addition to a desire to maintain spelling, is why retroflex consonants are transcribed as alveolar,
and tenuis occlusive obstruents are transcribed as voiced.
For palatal consonants, initial glides, and final nasals, the spelling depends on the equivalent Cantonese pronunciation.

Note that this table does not include stop codas, which are maintained in PUDUL.

#### Other

Many words from Nibasa come from languages outside of this list,
such as Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Swahili, Tamil, Nahuatl, Tupi, or Taino.
Such words follow consistent spelling systems when possible,
but it is not necessary to enumerate those systems here in full.
In general, Nibasa words should be faithful to their sources' native pronunciations,
and favor spellings that are similar to their sources' native spellings.
However, these principles are balanced against the phonotactic constraints,
which are satisfied for every PIL root.

#### Proper, technical, and culturally specific terms

When a word is a name (like `Tsvana desa`), very technical (like `darmstatiu`), or specific to a particular culture (like `sushi`), different transcription rules apply.  Matching the native spelling of the word as nearly as possible takes on a higher priority, and making it easy to pronounce takes on a lower priority.  Accordingly, the phonotactic constraints are more lenient and a larger phonetic inventory is available for such words.

More specifically, the general process for adopting a proper, technical, or culturally specific term into PUDUL can be described thus.
1. Take the official or most standard romanization of the word from its native language, or its native spelling if it's already in the Roman alphabet.
2. For each letter, judge whether it needs to be remapped to the corresponding letter in PUDUL:
   1. If its sound in the native language is the same as its sound in PUDUL, leave it.
   2. Else, if it is silent in the native language, omit it (for example, _Paris_ -> `Pari`).
   3. Else, if it is a letter not used in PUDUL, or a digraph that would be interpreted as two letters in PUDUL, remap it (for example, _Szilard_ -> `Silard`).
   4. Else, if its sound in the native language is completely different from its sound in PUDUL, remap it (for example, _guqin_ -> `gucin`).
   5. Else, if its sound in the native language phonemically contrasts with its sound in PUDUL, remap it (for example, _Brasil_ -> `Brazil`).
   6. Else, leave it (for example, _Einstein_ is _not_ changed to _Ainshtain_ because PUDUL's [ei̯] and [st] are similar to German's [a])
3. Make any adjustments to satisfy PUDUL's phonotactics (for example, _Uruguay_ -> `Uruguai`).
3. If the native word has stress that does not match PUDUL's stress rule, place an acute accent on the stressed vowel.

For example, consider the Italian word _pizza_.  Italian already uses the Latin alphabet, so there's no need to romanize.  We consider each letter:
- The letter _p_ represents [p] in Italian but [pʰ] in PUDUL.  However, because these sounds are not completely different (only one feature distinguishes them) and they do not contrast in Italian (which has no [pʰ]), the native letter is left unchanged.
- The letter _i_ represents the same sound in both Italian and PUDUL, so it is left unchanged.
- The letter _z_ represents [t͡s] in Italian but [z] in PUDUL.  These sounds are not completely different.  However, [z] is also a phoneme in Italian that can contrast with [t͡s] (see _Pisa_ for a near-minimal pair).  Therefore, it must be remapped to [t͡s].
- The letter _a_ represents the same sound in both Italian and PUDUL, so it is left unchanged.
Because there are two *z*s in _pizza_, the PUDUL word should arguably have two *ts*s (_pitstsa_).  However, this would violate the rule that PUDUL words don't have double consonants, so one is dropped to leave _pitsa_.  The stress in Italian is on the first syllable, which agrees with the default PUDUL stress for this word, so no acute accent is needed.

### word derivation

Many Nibasa words are formed by combining two existing roots into a compound word.
The two base words are connected using a hyphen “-”.
The first word modifies the meaninng of the second.

While there are no dedicated suffixes in Nibasa (every morpheme can stand as a word on its own),
some words are used as suffixes especially often.
These include:
- -`sei`, which indicates the object or medium of an action
- -`zen`, which indicates a person who performs an action or is associated with an idea
- -`gu`, which indicates a tool used to perform an action or handle an object
- -`makina`, which indicates a machine used to perform an action
- -`sito`, which indicates a place where an action occurs or an object can be found
- -`ki`, which indicates a period of time
- -`kolor`, which indicates the color of an object
- -`rang`, which forms the ordinals of numbers
- -`su`, which indicates an element or chemical
- -`du`, which indicates a degree
- -`te`, which indicates a state
- -`fa`, which indicates the becoming of a state

There are also some common prefixes for compound adjectives.
A compound adjective typically comprises an adjective followed by a noun.
The adjective is usually one of `te` or `nai`, `bon` or `dus`, `dai` or `mini`, `poli` or `sau`, `tele` or `karip`, `fasil` or `muskil`, or `teza` or `mirdu`.
You can think of it as a noun phrase that describes a quality.
The antonym of the compound adjective can then be formed by inverting the first element.

Compound postpositions also exist to describe many of the specific ways a noun can relate to a sentence, though these are not true compound words and accordingly use spaces instead of hyphens.
For example, `tema pe` is used as a postposition to indicate the topic of a discussion,
and `bi ze` is used to indicate the reference point of a comparison.

### pseudomorphemes

There are two suffixes that cannot stand as words on their own, but that do hint at the meaning of a root.
Therefore, roots will sometimes be modified from their most regular transcriptions to include these.
- Roots that end in -ia or -ya always describe places (for example, "topia").
- Roots that end in -iu or -yu always describe chemical elements (for example, "litiu").
These don't necessarily apply to three-letter words, like "dia", or to proper names, like "Melayu".

## grammar

The grammar of PUDUL is based on unchanging content words that can fill any part of speech.
For example, the word “ai” can mean "(n.) love", "(v.) to love", "(a.) loving; beloved", or "(av.) lovingly".
The context determines the word's part of speech.
Generally, nouns are followed by postpositions, verbs come at the ends of clauses,
adjectives come before nouns, and adverbs come before verbs.

Note in the above example that verbal roots used as adjectives often serve as participles.
A more explicit way to form a participle is to suffix it with "nun" (for example, "ai nun").
This is required if the participle has arguments.
There is no distinction between active or passive participles.
Most cases where the difference is important are satisfied by the suffixes
"-zen" ("-er"), "-sei" ("-ee"), "-fa" ("-ing"), and "-lio" ("-ed").
<!--TODO how awesome would it be to automatically link to those words in the dictionary-->

### phrases

A noun phrase is composed of a head noun optionally preceded by:
- an adjective,
- a noun phrase followed by `di`, or
- a clause followed by `nun`.

A verb phrase, which is a complete clause in PUDUL, is composed of a verb (the predicate) optionally preceded by:
- an adverb optionally followed by `li`,
- a noun phrase followed by a postposition, or
- a clause followed by `nun` and a postposition.

Noun phrases are not marked for number or definiteness by default.
Modifiers like `te:a`, `go:a`, or `mi di:a` may be used to explicitly express definiteness,
while adjectives like `un`, `dua`, or `poli` may be used to express number.
Pudul nouns do not have grammatical gender.

There are two conjunctions: _va_ (and) and _ao_ (or).
They connect two or more noun phrases, two or more verb phrases, or two or more modifiers.

### clauses

A basic clause in PuDuL is composed of a series of noun phrases marked with postpositions, followed by a predicate.
There are six postpositions in PuDuL:
- ga (nominative)
- ro (accusative)
- li (dative, also sometimes marks adverbs)
- ze (ablative)
- na (locative)
- di (genitive, not typically used in clauses)

The predicate may be a verb, adjective, or noun.
While it is usually clear from semantics whether a content word at the end of the sentence is a verb or an adjective,
nouns can sometimes be ambiguous.
In that event, the suffix `te:v`, which can be translated as “to be”, should be appended to the predicate.

The exact assignment of postpositions can be determined from the type of predicate as follows:
- For the existential predicate `te:v`, the subject is marked with `ga` and the possessor is marked with `di`.
- For noun predicates, the subject is marked with "ga".
- For adjectives of state, the subject is marked with "ga".
- For adjectives of position, the subject is marked with "ga" and the reference is marked with "ze".
- For adjectives of relation, the subject is marked with "ga" and the reference is marked with "na".
- For adjectives or verbs of emotion, the stimulus is marked with "ga" and the experiencer is marked with "ro".
- For verbs of giving and telling, the source is marked with "ga", the object is marked with "ro", and the destination with "li".
- For verbs of taking and learning, the recipient is marked with "ga", the object is marked with "ro", and the source is marked with "li".
- For verbs of motion, the subject is marked with "ga", the origin is marked with "ze", the destination is marked with "li", and the location or means is marked with "na".
- For other intranstive verbs, the subject is marked with "ga".
- For other transitive verbs, the agent is marked with "ga" and the patient is marked with "ro".
- The auxiliary verb [] forms the causative of a sentence: whatever would normally be marked with "ga" is marked with "li" instead, and the cause is marked with "ga" in its place (unless it’s a verb of giving or taking?).
- The auxiliary verb [] forms the passive of a sentence: whatever would normally be marked with "ro" is marked with "ga" and what would normally be marked with "ga" is marked with "ze" (unless it’s a verb of giving or taking?).

*CONFLICT*: does that mean that explicitly causative verbs of emotion take "li" while implicitly causative verbs of emotion take "ro"? I’d like to match Japanese... に食べさせる vs. を驚かせる? I also want passive and causative to be consistent with each other, and consistent with "don" and "get".

Naturally, adjunct phrases can always be added to specify additional contextual details; "li" marks destinations, goals, and manners, "na" marks locations, paths, and instruments, and "ze" marks origins, causes, and points of comparison.
Such adjuncts often use compound postpositions such as "gol li", "util na", and "bi ze" to clarify their role.

The topic is usually placed first and the comment last,
but other than that, the noun phrases may be in any order.
The subject may always be ommitted when it is implied or nonreferential.

Many Pudul verbs are ambitransitive, meaning they can be used either transitively or intransitively.

Auxiliary verbs go after the content verb.

Subordinate clauses are formed by adding "nun" after the verb.
Relative clauses appear before the noun they modify, and are also suffixed with "nun".
The role of the head noun in the relative clause is encoded only with a gap
(the gap should be a missing postpositional phrase; hanging postpositions are not allowed in Pudul).

### existential and possessive statements

Existential statements are formed with the predicate “te”.

There is no PUDUL verb meaning “to have”.
Possession is indicated by combining the genitive particle “di” with the existential predicate “te”.
For example, the sentence "I have a cat." is expressed as "mi di miao ga te.".

### auxiliary verbs

The following table summarizes the potential and causative auxiliary verbs.

| PUDUL | English |
|:------|:--------|
| konong | potential (I can) |
| konong nai | inability (I cannot) |
| neses nai | (I don't have to) |
| neses | requirement (I must) |
| permisi | permission (I may) |
| permisi nai | forbiddance (I may not) |
| debe nai | non-obligation(I don't have to) |
| debe | obligation (I must) |

The following table summarizes the auxiliary verbs of aspect.

| PUDUL | Aspect |
|:------|:--------|
| vancen | perfect (I have done) |
| klin | habitual (I tend to do) |
| kaisi | incohative (I start doing) |
| keizuk | continuous (I am doing) |
| fin | cessative (I stop doing) |

There are no auxiliary verbs for conditionality.
A clause is implied to be conditional when it is preceded by a "… nun gar na" phrase.

### sentence-level markings

Tense is indicated with specific phrases like “pos den pe" (“tomorrow”), or left unspecified.
Commonly used phrases include:
- goku pe = in the past
- henzai pe = currently
- futuro pe = in the future

Mood is marked with particles after the predicate.
The most common mood particles are:
- nai (negative)
- ke (interrogative)
- latif (polite imperative)
- yao (direct imperative)

There is no subjunctive or hypothetical mood in Pudul.
Conditional sentences are apparent from the inclusion of a conditional clause that ends with “nun gar pe.
For example, “tu ga bina nun gar pe, zen ga lai” (“if you build it, they will come”).

Voice is not marked in Pudul.
A passive voice can be approximated by reversing the usual order of the “ga” phrase and “ro” phrase.
Reflexive and reciprocal voices should be explicitly described by inserting the phrase “auto ro” or “un alo ro”.
