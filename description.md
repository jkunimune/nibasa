# How does it work?

# phonology

common PIL roots are composed of eighteen distinct consonants and five vowels.
in this table, IPA is given in parentheses when it differs from the orthography, which is not in parentheses.

|           | labial   | coronal    | palatal | dorsal   | 
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| nasal     | m        | n          |         | ng (ŋ)   |
| stop      | p (pʰ) ⋅ b | t (tʰ) ⋅ d   | c (t͡ʃʰ) | k (kʰ) ⋅ g |
| fricative | f        | s ⋅ z (z~d͡z) |         | h (x~h)  |
| glide     | v (w~v)  | l ⋅ r (r~ɹ)  | y (j)   |          |

|       | front | back |
|-------|-------|------|
| close | i     | u    |
| mid   | e     | o    |
| open  | a     |      |

there exist several additional letters that are only used in proper names and culturally specific terms (like arts and dishes):
- “zh” for the voiced postalveolar/retroflex fricative/affricate (ʒ\~ʐ or d͡ʒ\~ɖ͡ʐ)
- “sh” for the voiceless postalveolar/retroflex fricative (ʃ\~ʂ)
- “gh” for the voiced dorsal fricative (ɣ\~ʁ)
- “th” and “dh” for the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives (θ and ð)
- “lh” for the voiceless lateral approximant or lateral fricative (l̥\~ɬ)
- “mh”, “nh”, “ngh”, and “rh” for voiceless sonorants (m̥, n̥, ŋ̊, and r̥\~ɹ̥)
- "ts" for the voiceless alveolar affricate (t͡s)
- “kc” and “gc” for the voiceless and voiced laminal clicks (k͡|\~k͡ǂ and ɡ͡|\~ɡ͡ǂ)
- “q” and “gq” for the voiceless and voiced postalveolar clicks (k͡! and ɡ͡!)
- “x” and “gx” for the voiceless and voiced lateral clicks (k͡ǁ and ɡ͡ǁ)
- “pc” and “bc” for the voiceless and voiced labial clicks (k͡ʘ and g͡ʘ)
- “’” for the glottal stop (ʔ), for ejective stops (kʼ), and to separate digraphs (e.g. n.ɡ, t.h)
- “á”, “é”, “í”, “ó”, and “ú” for irregular stress

## phonotactics

in general, there are two firm rules that are never violated for any PIL word:
- the nucleus of every syllable is a vowel, or a diphthong composed of an open or mid vowel followed by a close vowel.
- the semivowels “y” and “v” are always followed by a vowel.
- adjacent identical consonants are forbidden.

there are also several stricter rules that apply to common PIL roots (as opposed to proper names or culturally specific terms).
- the onset of every syllable is either a single consonant or an obstruent followed by a liquid.
- the coda of a syllable is a single consonant.
- adjacent obstruents always agree in voicing.
- nasal consonants always agree with the following consonant when the following consonant is an occlusive.
- stops always differ in place of articulation from the following consonant unless the following consonant is “r”.
- the letters "s”, "z”, and "c” never occur next to each other.
- semivowels never appear adjacent to their corresponding vowel.
- a word never ends with a voiced obstruent.
- the vowel sequence “eu” is never used.
- roots typically contain no more than three syllables.

while there is no minimum length for common roots,
one- and two-letter roots are typically reserved for grammatical particles and common suffixes.

## stress

A PIL word should be pronounced with one syllable for each vowel or closed diphthong “ai”, “au”, “oi”, “ei”, or “ou”.
Stress falls before the last consonant or closed diphthong.

/gé.o/
/pu.táu̯/
/kris.tál/
/dú.ni.a/
/gu.rú.be/
/res.to.rán/

## capitalization

By convention, capital letters are used to mark proper names.
PIL roots always start with lowercase letters, even at the beginning of a sentence.


# vocabulary

Nibasa words are chosen to maximize international recognizability.
Names of elements are always taken from Latin such that they correspond to the chemical symbol.
Names of living things with limited ranges are taken from a language spoken in the region where it is common.
Names of living things that exist across a large enough area are based on their scientific name,
unless the scientific name is obscure or another common name is particularly internationally recognizable.

PIL words should have meanings as close as possible to the natural words they are based on.
For example, even though the genus *Chrysanthemum* is native to China,
the Latin root “chrysanthema” is preferred over the Chinese root “菊” for its PIL name,
because “chrysanthema” specifically refers to *Chrysanthemum* while “菊” also refers to other plants in the family *Asteraceae*.
On the other hand, for the order *Hymenoptera*,
the Chinese root “蜂” is preferred over the Latin roots “apis” and “vespa”,
because “蜂” covers the full order while “apis” and “vespa” make a nonphyletic distinction.
<!-- TODO: ants make this a bad example -->

## spelling conventions

The following tables describe the standard transcription style of Nibasa.
This is how new words should be respelld when added to the dictionary.
Note that these rules are neither fast nor hard,
and there may be variations when a word comes from a different source,
or from a combination of several.

\* Nouns describing people and adjectives all take “-e” instead of “-a” or “-o”.
\*\* Masculine or neuter "-i” is expanded to "-iu” for the names of chemical elements.
\*\*\* Feminine or Greek “-i” is expanded to “-ia” for words representing places that would otherwise be two syllables.

words should be adapted as whatever part of speech is most semantically appropriate.
when multiple parts of speech would be reasonable, nouns should be preferred, followed by verbs, then adjectives.
prefixing forms should only be used if all other forms are now rare.

Generally, “c” is soft when followed by “i”, “e”, or “y” and hard otherwise.
However, note that Nibasa treats “c” as hard if it is hard in Russian (as descendants of Greek "κ” usually are).

Generic suffixes are omitted entirely if they have been lost in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and doing so does not violate the phonotactics.  Note that the suffix is not considered lost from English if there's still a silent "-e" (so "lake" is still "lako", not "lak").

Words recently loaned from Latin that retain their full Latinate suffix in modern languages, such as "virus", naturally also retain their full suffix in Nibasa.

### English

English is currently the most widely spoken...

\* voiced stops are transliterated as voiceless stops when at the end of the word.
\*\* a “t” is included in the transliterated word if it would otherwise only be two letters long (e.g. “sat”).

Arabic roots are taken in the form that is most internationally widespread; usually as CaCiC(a) adjectives or CaCaC(a) nouns.
adjectives are taken as masculine, unless doing so would cause the word to end with a semivowel or voiced obstruent.

The digraphs /aj/ and /aw/ are transcribed as “ej” and “ou” where permitted by the phonotactics, and “e” and “o” elsewhere, I think (maimun?).
Verbs and adverbs should generally be converted to adjectives or nouns, respectively before being transliterated.
Nouns of variable gender and adjectives are transcribed as masculine, unless doing so would violate the phonotactics.

Schwas should usually be transcribed as "a”, but may be omitted to preserve stress.

### Chinese

Chinese roots have spread...
This table is based on Mandarin, since it's by far the most spoken chinese language,
but the transcription style is based on a consideration of all chinese and Chinese-adjacent languages.
That, in addition to a desire to maintain spelling, is why retroflex consonants are transcribed as alveolar,
and tenuis occlusive obstruents are transcribed as voiced.
For palatal consonants, initial glides, and final nasals, the spelling depends on the equivalent Cantonese pronunciation.

Note that this table does not include stop codas, which are maintained from Old Chinese.

### Other

Many words from Nibasa come from languages outside of this list,
such as Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Swahili, Tamil, Nahuatl, Tupi, or Taino.
Such words follow consistent spelling systems when possible,
but it is not necessary to enumerate those systems here in full.
In general, Nibasa words should be faithful to their sources' native pronunciations,
and favor spellings that are similar to their sources' native spellings when possible.
However, these principles are balanced against the phonotactic constraints,
which are satisfied for every PIL root.

Proper names follow the same principles as PIL roots, but have more lenient phonotactic constraints and a larger phonetic inventory to allow more faithful transcription.
They thus should always match the name's native spelling or romanization as closely as possible, except to account for differences between the native spelling system and PIL's
(for example, the "H" in "Aiti").

Acute accents are used to mark stress in proper names when the native stress is different from the regular Nibasa stress.
These accents not always included in informal writing.
They are not used for names from tonal or quasi-tonal languages, such as Thai or Japanese.

## word derivation

Many Nibasa words are formed by combining two existing roots into a compound word.
The two base words are connected using a hyphen “-”.
The first word modifies the meaninng of the second,
and the part-of-speech is inherited from the second.
For example, (put a good compound noun example here).

While there are no dedicated suffixes in Nibasa (every morpheme can stand as a word on its own),
some words are used as suffixes especially often.
These include:
- -{sei}, which indicates the object or medium of an action
- -{zen}, which indicates a person who performs an action or is associated with an idea
- -{gu}, which indicates a tool used to perform an action or handle an object
- -{makina}, which indicates a machine used to perform an action
- -{sito}, which indicates a place where an action occurs or an object can be found
- -{ki}, which indicates a period of time
- -{kolor}, which indicates the color of an object
- -{rang}, which forms the ordinals of numbers
- -{su}
- -{do}
- -{te}
- -{fa}

This structure is especially common for adjectives.
A compound adjective typically comprises a noun, indicating the aspect or quality the adjective modifies,
and one of {bon} or {dus}, {dai} or {mini}, {poli} or {sau}, {tele} or {karip}, {fasil} or {muskil}, or {teza} or {mirdu}.
The antonym of the compound adjective can then be formed by inverting the second element.

Compound postpositions also exist to describemany of the specific ways a noun can relate to a sentence, though these are not true compound words and accordingly use spaces instead of hyphens.
For example, {tema pe} is used as a postposition to indicate the topic of a discussion,
and {bi ze} is used to indicate the reference point of a comparison.

## pseudomorphemes

There are two suffixes that cannot stand as words on their own, but that do hint at the meaning of a root.
Therefore, roots will sometimes be modified from their most regular transcriptions to include these.
- Roots that end in -ia or -ja always describe places (for example, "topia").
- Roots that end in -iu or -ju always describe chemical elements (for example, "litiu").
These don't neccessarily apply to three-letter words, like "dia", or to proper names, like "Melayu".

# grammar

The grammar of PUDUL is based on unchanging content words that can fill any part of speech.
For example, the word “ai” can mean "(n.) love", "(v.) to love", "(a.) loving; beloved", or "(av.) lovingly".
The context determines the word's part of speech.
Generally, nouns are followed by postpositions, verbs come at the ends of clauses,
adjectives come before nouns, and adverbs come before verbs.

Note in the above example that verbal roots used as adjectives often serve as participles.
A more explicit way to form a participle is to suffix it with "nun" (for example, "ai nun").
This is required if the participle has arguments.
There is no distinction between active or passive participles.
Most cases where the difference is important are satisfied by the suffixes
"-jen" ("-er"), "-sei" ("-ee"), "-fa" ("-ing"), and "-lio" ("-ed").
<!--TODO how awesome would it be to automatically link to those words in the dictionary-->

## phrases

Simple phrases in PUDUL are composed of simple sequences of content words.
The last word in a phrase is the head, and the others modify it.
When three content words appear in sequence, it is ambiguous whether the first one modifies the second modifier, or the head.
For example, the phrase "vere bar-sei dokumen" can mean “a truly important document”, or “a true, important document”.
The genitive particle “di” exists to clarify such ambiguities when they arise.
It separates a modifier from the word it modifies.
As such, it is never strictly necessary, but is useful for grouping words together.
For example, "vere bar-sei di dokumen" means “a truly important document”,
while "vere di bar-sei di dokumen" means “a true, important document”.

There are two conjunctions:
- e (and)
- o (or)
They may connect any kinds of phrases, including clauses.

Noun phrases are not marked for number or definiteness by default.
Adjectives like “ta” (“some”), “go” (“that”), or “mi di” (“my”) may be used to explicitly express definiteness,
while adjectives like “un” (“one”), “du” (“two”), or “poli” (“many”) may be used to express number.
Pudul nouns do not have grammatical gender.

## clauses

A basic clause in PuDuL is composed of a series of noun phrases marked with postpositions, followed by a predicate.
There are six postpositions in PuDuL:
- ga (nominative)
- ro (accusative)
- li (dative, also marks adverbs when they do not precede the verb)
- ze (ablative)
- na (locative)

The predicate may be a verb, adjective, or noun.
While it is usually clear from semantics whether a content word at the end of the sentence is a verb or an adjective,
nouns can sometimes be ambiguous.
In that event, the suffix “ta”, which can be translated as “to be”, should be appended to the predicate.

The exact assignment of postpositions can be determined from the type of predicate as follows:
- For the existential predicate "ta", the subject is marked with "ga" and the possessor is marked with "di" (the attributive postposition).
- For noun predicates, the subject is marked with "ga".
- For adjectives of state, the subject is marked with "ga".
- For adjectives of position, the subject is marked with "ga" and the reference is marked with "ze".
- For adjectives of relation, the subject is marked with "ga" and the reference is marked with "na".
- For adjectives or verbs of emotion, the stimulus is marked with "ga" and the experiencer is marked with "ro".
- For verbs of giving and telling, the source is marked with "ga", the theme is marked with "ro", and the destination with "li".
- For verbs of taking and learning, the recipient is marked with "ga", the theme is marked with "ro", and the source is marked with "li".
- For verbs of motion, the subject is marked with "ga", the origin is marked with "ze", the destination is marked with "li", and the location or means is marked with "na".
- For other intranstive verbs, the subject is marked with "ga".
- For other transitive verbs, the agent is marked with "ga" and the patient is marked with "ro".
- The auxiliary verb [] forms the causative of a sentence: whatever would normally be marked with "ga" is marked with "li" instead, and the cause is marked with "ga" in its place (unless it’s a verb of giving or taking?).
- The auxiliary verb [] forms the passive of a sentence: whatever would normally be marked with "ro" is marked with "ga" and what would normally be marked with "ga" is marked with "ze" (unless it’s a verb of giving or taking?).

*CONFLICT*: does that mean that explicitly causative verbs o femotion take "li" while implicitly cuasative verbs of emotion take "ro"? I’d like to match Japanese... に食べさせる vs. を驚かせる? I also want passive and causative to be consisten with each other, and consistent with "don" and "get".

Naturally, adjunct phrases can always be added to specify additional contextual details; "li" marks destinations, goals, and manners, "na" marks locations, paths, and instruments, and "ze" marks origins, causes, and poinst of comparison.
Such adjuncts often use compound postpositions such as "gol li", "util na", and "bi ze" to clarify their role.

The topic is usually placed first and the comment last,
but other than that, the noun phrases may be in any order.
The subject may always be ommitted when it is implied or nonreferential.

Many Pudul verbs are ambitransitive, meaning they can be used either transitively or intransitively.

Auxiliary verbs go after the content verb.

Subordinate clauses are formed by adding "nun" after the verb.
Relative clauses appear before the noun they modify, and are also suffixed with "nun".
The role of the head noun in the relative clause is encoded only with a gap
(the gap should be a missing postpositional phrase; hanging postpositions are not allowed in Pudul).

## existential and possessive statements

Existential statements are formed with the predicate “ta”.

There is no PUDUL verb meaning “to have”.
Posession is indicated by combining the genitive particle “di” with the existential predicate “ta”.
For example, the sentence "I have a cat." is expressed as "mi di mau ga ta.".

## auxiliary verbs

The following table summarizes the potential and causative auxiliary verbs.

| PUDUL | English |
|:------|:--------|
| konong | potential (I can) |
| konong nai | inability (I cannot) |
| neses nai | (I don't have to) |
| neses | requirement (I must) |
| permisi | permission (I may) |
| permisi nai | forbiddance (I may not) |
| debe nai | non-obligation(I don't have to) |
| debe | obligation (I must) |

The following table summarizes the auxiliary verbs of aspect.

| PUDUL | Aspect |
|:------|:--------|
| vancen | perfect (I have done) |
| klin | habitual (I tend to do) |
| kaisi | incohative (I start doing) |
| keizuk | continuous (I am doing) |
| fin | cessative (I stop doing) |

There are no auxiliary verbs for conditionality.
A clause is implied to be conditional when it is preceded by a "… nun gar na" phrase.

## Sentence-level markings

Tense is indicated with specific phrases like “pos den pe" (“tomorrow”), or left unspecified.
Commonly used phrases include:
- goku pe = in the past
- henzai pe = currently
- futuro pe = in the future
- ta (progressive aspect)
- = already
- ada (habitual aspect)

Mood is marked with particles immediately before the predicate.
The most common mood particles are:
- nai (negative)
- ke (interrogative)
- latif (polite imperative)
- yau (impolite imperative)
All of these particles may also be placed before the predicate with no difference in meaning except “ke”,
which would be interpreted as a direct object.

There is no subjunctive or hypothetical mood in Pudul.
Conditional sentences are apparent from the inclusion of a conditional clause that ends with “nun gar pe.
For example, “tu ga bina nun gar pe jen ga lai” (“if you build it, they will come”).

Voice is not marked in Pudul.
A passive voice can be approximated by reversing the usual order of the “ga” phrase and “ro” phrase.
Reflexive and reciprocal voices should be explicitly described by inserting the phrase “auto ro” or “un alo ro”.
