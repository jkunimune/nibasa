# Lesson 1: greetings

This is the first in a series of short online lessons to help get you speaking PUDUL in no time.
This lesson will focus on the common phrases needed for basic communication.

## Saying hello

The standard greeting in PUDUL is
`bon nit`

It's pronounced like "born neet" if you're British, or "bone neet" if you're American.

`bon` means "good" and `nit` means "day", so this literally means "good day".

There are other more specific greetings depending on the situation.
In the morning, you can use
`bon suba`
pronounced "born SOO-bah".
`suba` means "morning", so this literally means "good morning".

During the day, you can use
`bon dia`
pronounced "born DEE-ah".
`dia` means the part of the day when the sun is up.  Note that this overlaps with what we call "morning" and "afternoon" in English.
That means that between sunrise and noon, you can use any of `bon nit`, `bon suba`, or `bon dia` as you prefer.

In the afternoon and evening, you can use
`bon suare`
pronounced "born soo-WAH-reh", where `suare` means afternoon or evening.

Finally, at night, you can use
`bon noce`
The `c` is pronounced like the "ch" in "cheese", so this word is pronounced "born NO-cheh".
