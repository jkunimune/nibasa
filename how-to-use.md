# How does it work?

## Spelling and pronunciation

USL words are written using a simplified form of the Latin alphabet.
The letters *q* and *x* are not used in basic USL words.
This is to avoid confusion and ease the learning for people not familiar with the Latin alphabet.

When PIL words are pronounced out loud, they should always be pronounced phonetically.
There are no silent letters, and each letter is only pronounced one way.

- "a" is always open as in "father".
- "c" sounds like the "ch" in "charlie".
- "e" is always short as in "echo".
- "g" is always hard as in "get".
- "i" always sounds like the "i" in "machine".
- "o" always sounds like the "o" in "force".
- "r" may be smooth as it is in English or trilled as it is in Spanish or Hindi. It is never silent.
- "s" is always soft as in "thesis"
- "u" always sounds like the "oo" in "goose".
- "y" is always a consonant as in "yankey". It is never a vowel.

Compound words are formed by connecting smaller words with hyphens.

## Grammar

### Basic phrases

Simple phrases are formed by placing two words next to each other.
The meaning of the second word is modified by the first word.
For example:
- dai (large) + vaf (dog) = dai vaf (large dog)
- kafe (coffee) + kup (cup) = kafe kup (coffee cup)
- mi (me) + dosti (friend) = mi dosti (my friend)

### Complex phrases

Longer phrases can be formed by combining more words.
The word "di" may be used to break phrases up to make their structures clear.

- pul put di kaguzi di sak = bag of completely soaked paper
- pul di put kaguzi di sak = bag full of wet paper
- pul di sip di kaguzi sak = full and wet paper bag

### Basic sentences

Complete sentences are formed in USL by combining postpositional phrases with a predicate.

A prepositional phrase ends with one of the six postpositions, which specifies.
- "ga" indicates the subject of an action. (mi ga yam = I eat)
- "ro" indicates the object of an action. (ris ro yam = eat rice)
- "na" indicates the location of an action. (meza na yam = eat at a table)
- "do" indicates the destination of an action. ()
- "ze"
- "e"

If there are multiple postpositional phrases, then "ro" should generally come last;
some speakers may prefer to place "ga" before or after the other postpositions according to personal style.
The postpositional phrase next to the verb can usually have its postposition omitted.
- meza na dosti e mi ga ris (ro) yam. I eat rice at a table with a friend.

A predicate can be a noun, adjective, or verb.
- mau ga kore. = The cat runs.
- mau ga rubi. = The cat is red.
- mau ga mi dosti. = The cat is my friend.

Sentences do not need to start with capital letters.

### Complex sentences

### Proper names

Proper names of countries are re-spelled in Nibasa's alphabet.
Personal names and city names will inevitably be spelled irregularly in many circumstances.
Proper names have access to the bonus letters.
They must be followd by a common noun to identify them (e.g. Franse desa, Suahili basa, Smith jen, Jorje raja, Zamenhof dotor)

### Other things

Requests and commands are formed by adding a modal word to the end of the sentence.
Different words imply different levels of directness.
- mun kai latifa. = Would you please open the door?
- mun kai bon. = You had better open the door.
- mun kai debe. = You have to open the door.
- mun kai yau. = You need to open the door.

Negative requests and commands are formed by putting "no" between the verb and the modal word.
- mun kai no yau. = You must not open the door.

Conjunctions

Simple comparisons are made by adding the point of comparison followed by "bi ze".
- mi ga tu bi ze rapide kore abil. = I can run faster than you.
- mi ga tu bi ze sar bon no. = I'm not as smart as you.

More precise comparisons can be made by adding "zoi" or "par".
- mi ga mi-mon bi ze zoi lau. = I am the oldest of us.
- mi ga tu bi ze par ????. = I am just as stubborn as you.
