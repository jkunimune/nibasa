# How does it work?

## Spelling and pronunciation

USL words are written using a simplified form of the Latin alphabet.
The letters *j*, *q*, and *x* are not used in basic USL words.

When PIL words are pronounced out loud, they should always be pronounced phonetically.
There are no silent letters, and each letter is only pronounced one way.

- "a" is always open as in "father".
- "c" sounds like the "ch" in "charlie".
- "e" is always short as in "dress".
- "g" is always hard as in "get".
- "i" always sounds like the "i" in "machine".
- "o" always sounds like the "o" in "force".
- "s" is always soft as in "sass"
- "u" always sounds like the "u" in "rude".
- "y" is always a consonant as in "yes". It is never a vowel.
- "ai" sounds like the "i" in "prize".
- "ao" sounds like the "ou" in "mouth".
- "ei" sounds like the "ei" in "vein".
- "oi" sounds like the "oi" in "choice".
- "ou" sounds like the "ou" in "dough".

Compound words are formed by connecting smaller words with hyphens.

### Proper names

### Compound words

### stress

Stress falls on the last vowel if the word ends in a consonant,
or the second-to-last vowel if the word ends in a vowel.

/*gé*.o/
/*bá*.sa/
/ha.*lóu̯*/
/kris.*tál*/
/du.*ní*.a/
/gu.*rú*.be/
/res.to.*rán*/

## Grammar

### Noun phrases

Nouns in Pudul do not require articles, and they have a single form regardless of whether they are plural or singular.
Adjectives are placed before the noun.
For example:
- dai (large) + vaf (dog) = dai vaf (large dog)
- kafe (coffee) + kup (cup) = kafe kup (coffee cup)
- mi (me) + dosti (friend) = mi dosti (my friend)

Longer phrases can be formed by combining more words.
...

### Verb phrases

Verbs in PUDUL have a single form regardless of whether the action is past or present, or of who the subject is.

Most of the time a verb phrase is composed of only a single verb.
However, adverbs can also be added before the main verb, optionally separated with "li".
- kore = "to run"
- rapide (li) kore = "to run quickly"

Multiple verbs can also be chained together, optionally separated with "nun".
The first verb is called the content verb, and can be anything.
The second verb is called the auxiliary verb, and is usually one of the following:
- konong = "can"
- neses = "need to"
- yau = "want"
- permis = "may"
- debe = "must"
- proba = "try to"
- vancen = "have"
- klin = "tend to"
- kaisi = "start …ing"
- keizuk = "keep …ing"
- fin = "stop …ing"
- sana = "make someone"

Multiple auxiliary verbs can be chained together in the same fashion.

### Basic sentences

The most basic sentence structure in Pudul is

<u>*subject* ga</u> <u>*predicate*</u>.

The subject can be any noun, and the predicate can be a noun, adjective, or verb.

- mau ga dosti. = The cat is a friend.
- mau ga rubi. = The cat is red.
- mau ga kore. = The cat runs.

When a verb requires two nouns, the sentence structure becomes

<u>*subject* ga</u> <u>*object* ro</u> <u>*predicate*</u>.

- mau ga pes ro yam. = The cat eats fish.

The words "ga" and "ro" are called *postpositions*.
There are three others that can be used to add additional nouns to a sentence.

- "na" indicates the location of an action. (meza na jam = eat at a table)
- "do" indicates the destination of an action. ()
- "ze"

If there are multiple postpositional phrases, then "ro" should generally come last;
some speakers may prefer to place "ga" before or after the other postpositions according to personal style.
- meza na dosti e mi ga ris ro yam. I eat rice at a table with a friend.

Sentences do not start with capital letters.

### Complex sentences

Subordinate clauses are formed by adding 

### Unusual sentence orders

Occasionally it is useful to alter the normal subject–object–verb sentence order for emphasis.
To add emphasis to the object, the object is occasionally placed before the subject.

- `ris ro mi ga yam.`  
  'Rice, I eat.'

Alternatively, the object can be placed after the verb using the construction `nun sei ga`.

- `mi ga yam nun sei ga ris.`  
  'It is rice that I eat.' or 'What I eat is rice.'

The subject can be emphasized by placing it after the verb in a similar fashion.

- `ris ro yam nun zen ga mi.`  
  'It is I who eats rice.' or 'The one who eats rice is me.'

### Proper names

Proper names of countries are re-spelled in Nibasa's alphabet.
Personal names and city names will inevitably be spelled irregularly in many circumstances.
Proper names have access to the bonus letters.
They must be followd by a common noun to identify them (e.g. Franse desa, Suahili basa, Smith jen, Jorje raja, Zamenhof doktor)

### Questions

Yes-or-no questions are formed by adding "ke" ("what") to the end of a sentence.
- tu ga da abil ke? = Can you do that?

Nibasa does not have a word for "yes".
To answer a yes-or-no question in the affirmative, simply repeat the last word before "ke".
To answer a yes-or-no question in the negative, one can simply use "nai" ("not"),
or repeat the last word of the question followed by "nai".
- abil. = Yes, I can.
- abil nai. = No, I can't.

Open questions are not specially marked, as they are apparent from the presence of the word "ke",
which can modify a noun or act as a noun of its own.
- tu ga ke jen? = Who are you?
- ke ro yam? = What are you eating?
- ke li moto? = Where did it go?
- ke sabu na da yang? = Why is she like this?

### Requests and commands

Requests and commands are formed by adding a modal word to the end of the sentence.
Different words imply different levels of directness.
- mun kai latifa. = Would you please open the door?
- mun kai bon. = You had better open the door.
- mun kai debe. = You have to open the door.
- mun kai neses. = You need to open the door.

Negative requests and commands are formed by putting "nai" between the verb and the modal word.
- mun kai nai neses. = You must not open the door.

Commands are the only sentences that can have an object without a subject.
- ris ro yam debe. = Eat rice.

Note that unlike in some languages, the subject is never left out of statements or questions.

### Comparisons and measurements

Simple comparisons are expressed as normal sentences.
- tren e fei-makin ze, ke fang ga rapide? fei-makin ga rapide. = Which is faster, going by train or going by plane? The plane is faster.
Simple comparisons are made by adding the point of comparison followed by "bi ze" or "do na".
- mi ga *tu bi ze* rapide kore abil. = I can run faster *than you*.
- mi ga *tu do na* sar bon nai. = I'm not as smart *as you*.

Units of measurement are placed between the number and the object being modified.
- mi ga 2 litro sui ro yam. = I drink 2 liters of water.
- mi ga 163 senti-metro gao. = I am 163 centimeters tall.
- mi ga 10 nen lao. = I am 10 years old.

## Other things

### Dates and times

Dates in PuDuL are typically expressed in the following format:

- `1887 nen 7 muezi 26 dia`  
  '1887, July 26th'

However, the year, month, and day are sometimes placed in other orders depending on the location and preference of the speaker.  The words `nen`, `muezi`, and `dia` always indicate which number is which.

- `7 muezi 26 dia 1887 nen`  
  'July 26th, 1887'
- `26 dia 7 muezi 1887 nen`  
  '26th of July 1887'

Time is usually expressed in the 24-hour format like so:

- `16 hora 30 minuto`  
  '16:30'

Hours between midnight and noon are numbered 0 to 11, and hours between noon and midnight are numbered 12 to 23.

Sometimes, the 12-hour convention is used, where hours in both halves of the day are numbered 1 to 12.  In this case, the words `suba` and `cam` are used to disambiguate which period is being described:

- `cam 4 hora 30 minuto`
  '4:30 in the afternoon'
