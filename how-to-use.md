# How does it work?

## Spelling and pronunciation

USL words are written using a simplified form of the Latin alphabet.
The letters *q* and *x* are not used in basic USL words.
This is to avoid confusion and ease the learning for people not familiar with the Latin alphabet.

When PIL words are pronounced out loud, they should always be pronounced phonetically.
There are no silent letters, and each letter is only pronounced one way.

- "a" always sounds like the "a" in "father".
- "c" sounds like the "ch" in "charlie".
- "e" is always short as in "dress".
- "g" is always hard as in "get".
- "i" always sounds like the "i" in "machine".
- "o" always sounds like the "o" in "force".
- "r" may be smooth as it is in English or trilled as it is in Spanish or Hindi. It is never silent.
- "s" is always soft as in "sass"
- "u" always sounds like the "oo" in "goose".
- "y" is always a consonant as in "yes". It is never a vowel.

Compound words are formed by connecting smaller words with hyphens.

### Compound words

## stress

Stress falls on the syllable before the last consonant or digraph.

## Grammar

### Basic phrases

Simple phrases are formed by placing two words next to each other.
The meaning of the second word is modified by the first word.
For example:
- dai (large) + vaf (dog) = dai vaf (large dog)
- kafe (coffee) + kup (cup) = kafe kup (coffee cup)
- mi (me) + dosti (friend) = mi dosti (my friend)

### Complex phrases

Longer phrases can be formed by combining more words.
...

Sometimes, when a phrase becomes too long, it can be difficult to discern the structure.
Consider the example phrase
- dai vaf dom

This phrase is unclear, because "dai" might be describing the dog, or the house.
In English, we might clarify this by using the word "of".
- the house of big dogs
- the big house of dogs

When we use "of", we rearrange the phrase and space out its components.
Similarly, in Nibasa, we use "di".
Unlike "of", it does not change the order of the phrase.
However, it does divide the components in a way that makes the phrase structure more clear.

- dai vad di dom = ""
-

Because adjectives and adverbs are the same in Nibasa, we sometimes use it in situations where we would never use "of" in English.
- pul put di kaguzi di sak = bag of completely soaked paper
- pul di put kaguzi di sak = bag full of wet paper
- pul di sip di kaguzi sak = full and wet paper bag

### Basic sentences

Complete sentences are formed in USL by combining postpositional phrases with a predicate.

A postpositional phrase ends with one of the six postpositions, which specifies.
- "ga" indicates the subject of an action. (mi ga jam = I eat)
- "ro" indicates the object of an action. (ris ro jam = eat rice)
- "na" indicates the location of an action. (meza na jam = eat at a table)
- "do" indicates the destination of an action. ()
- "ze"
- "e"

If there are multiple postpositional phrases, then "ro" should generally come last;
some speakers may prefer to place "ga" before or after the other postpositions according to personal style.
- meza na dosti e mi ga ris ro yam. I eat rice at a table with a friend.

A predicate can be a noun, adjective, or verb.
- mau ga kore. = The cat runs.
- mau ga rubi. = The cat is red.
- mau ga mi di dosti. = The cat is my friend.

Sentences do not start with capital letters.

### Complex sentences

Commands are indicated by adding to the end of the sentence...

Commands are the only sentences that can have an object without a subject.
- ris ro yam deve. = Eat rice.

Note that unlike in some languages, the subject is never left out of statements or questions.

### Proper names

Proper names of countries are re-spelled in Nibasa's alphabet.
Personal names and city names will inevitably be spelled irregularly in many circumstances.
Proper names have access to the bonus letters.
They must be followd by a common noun to identify them (e.g. Franse desa, Suahili basa, Smith jen, Jorje raja, Zamenhof doktor)

### Other things

Yes-or-no questions are formed by adding "ke" ("what") to the end of a sentence.
- tu ga go abil? = Can you do that?

Nibasa does not have a word for "yes".
To answer a yes-or-no question in the affirmative, simply repeat the last word before "ke".
To answer a yes-or-no question in the negative, one can simply use "no" ("not"),
or repeat the last word of the question followed by "no".
- abil. = Yes, I can.
- abil no. = No, I can't.

Open questions are not specially marked, as they are apparent from the presence of the word "ke",
which can modify a noun or act as a noun of its own.
- tu ga ke jen? = Who are you?
- ke ro yam? = What are you eating?
- ke li moto? = Where did it go?
- ke sabu na ni yang? = Why is she like this?

Requests and commands are formed by adding a modal word to the end of the sentence.
Different words imply different levels of directness.
- mun kai latifa. = Would you please open the door?
- mun kai bon. = You had better open the door.
- mun kai debe. = You have to open the door.
- mun kai neses. = You need to open the door.

Negative requests and commands are formed by putting "no" between the verb and the modal word.
- mun kai no neses. = You must not open the door.

Conjunctions

Simple comparisons are made by adding the point of comparison followed by "bi ze".
- mi ga tu bi ze rapide kore abil. = I can run faster than you.
- mi ga tu bi ze sar bon no. = I'm not as smart as you.

More precise comparisons can be made by adding "zoi" or "par".
- mi ga mi-mon bi ze zoi lau. = I am the oldest of us.
- mi ga tu sam na ????. = I am just as stubborn as you.
