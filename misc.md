# on the spelling of /w/

the following table shows the use of the four relevant graphemes in Pandunia's source languages.

| basha           | ⟨v⟩ di valu  | ⟨w⟩ di valu  |
| english         |      v      |      w      |
| espanya         |     b~β     |      w*     |
| franse          |      v      |      w*     |
| turki           |      v      |      v*     |
| suahili         |      v      |      w      |
| malayu          |      v      |      w      |
| viete           |      v      |             |
| putong han      |             |      w      |
| nipon (roma zi) |      v*     |      w      |
| rus (roma zi)   |      v      |             |
| arabi (roma zi) |             |      w      |
| hindi (roma zi) |      ʋ      |             |
| cosen (roma zi) |             |      w      |

| basha           | ⟨v⟩ di use | ⟨w⟩ di use |
| helen (roma zi) | absent     | absent     |
| latin           | common     | absent     |
| english         | common     | common     |
| arabi (roma zi) | absent     | common     |
| sanskrita (roma zi) | common (sometimes \[w\]) | absent     |
| han             | absent     | common     |

the goal is to make words as recognizable as possible.  that means matching native spellings as closely as possible when those native spellings are in the Latin alphabet.  to simplify the situation, we can look at the four main sources of Nibasa vocabulary.  we can prioritize languages that use the Latin alphabet.

between v and w, the choice is clear.
- Latin-influenced languages exclusively uses ⟨v⟩.
- the Arabic language uses /w/, but doesn't use the Latin alphabet.  when Arabic words are spelld with the Latin alphabet in Turkish and Swahili, they tend to use both ⟨v⟩ and ⟨w⟩ respectively.
- Middle Chinese has /w/, which is spelld ⟨w⟩ in most Chinese-influenced langauges, but none of them use the Latin alphabet as their primary script.
- Sanskrit languages tend to use both \[v\] and \[w\] as variations on /ʋ/, but don't use the Latin alphabet.


# other stuff

hello, I'm the scientific advisor to the new country of Hopeland (soon to be calld Nidesa).
subsequent to my primary policy goals of promoting nuclear energy and the new decimal time system, I am constructing a language for use in Hopeland.
it will be based primarily on Pandunia, but I want to comb thru the grammar, comparing it against that of Lidepla and Globasa for any good ideas.

tese | eng:thesis, por:tese, spa:may:tesis, fra:thèse, deu:These, rus:те́зис (tézis), tur:tez, ara:, fas:تز (tez), jpn:テーゼ (tēze), kor:테제 (teje) + swa:utetezi
alkasus, alkol, alkali -> kasus, kohol, kali
bucha -> buchar (check transcription of "-er")
gomu -> kauchu
klien -> keka
kave, tolera, rezerve -> kava, toler, rezerva
tong -> tung
hogo sanduku -> foto sanduku
minor -> legu
an zai -> hin
astatin -> astate
redi -> junbei
dokumen, restorante, hidrargente -> dokum, restoran, hidrargen
zou -> zo
zoku -> zuka
Koran -> Quran
lin -> liny to make room for lin=neighbor
lanca -> jeta to make room for lance
pulse could actually be better than darbe?

one simple root dictionary, organized by lexical category
one printed dictionary
one printed textbook
one printed light learning book (with basic words, examples, useful phrases, and a small glossary)
book of word puzzles

cut off all unnecessary letters; words that end in consonants are a-ok and will help reduce hiatus

the suffixes *ce*, *jen*, *gu*, *fa*, and *te* are often left out when the context is clear, much like in English:
- *mural*, short for *mural art*
- *tele-fon*, short for *tele-fon-macin*

English relative clauses restrict several useful formations:
putting a prepositional phrase before the part of the sentence with the relative pronoun
	You're talking about what it returns if you call "typeof" on it.
	\*You're talking about, if you call "typeof" on it, what it returns.
	You're talking about, if you call "typeof" on it, what does it return.
just relative clauses where you have a circumpositional idiom
	That's the barn that more cats have been born in the back of it than most vetrinary clinics in this country.
	That's the barn in the back of which which more cats have been born than in most vetrinary clinics in this country. (awkward)
it's confusing questions are different from subordinate interrogative clauses
	I don't know whether that is important.
	Is that important?
it's confusing how point of comparison is not always next to the comparative
	I eat more beans than most peeple.
	\*I eat more than most peeple beans.

it's much easier to pay attention to the semantic components of content words than to the orders of function words.
it's better to have a few content words with a clear structure than to make peeple understand the difference between nun le and le nun.
that's why the core philosophy of Nibasa is to minimize the number and functional load of structure words.
every word (besides the postpositions) has a tangible meaning, and their order doesn't matter much beyond with what other words they are associated.

no word class markers, including -to and -e.
many auxlangs struggle to balance three desirable features:
lack of mandatory grammatical marking, clear sentence structure, and loose word class.
I contend that a strictly head-final language is the solution.

the lessons should not have words like "jussive".
the reference grammar should not have words like "exhortation"

don't tell the reader about every possible combination of funccion words, and definitely don't blend them into single words.
just tell them useful phrases as they come up, and let the transparent grammar speak for itself.


any postposition can be omitted.
ro and di most commonly.
ga usually does change how the sentence is parsd.

the truncated morphemes are a sine that you are trying to pack too much information into each word for a language that is ostensibly isolating.

Nibasa reimagines the auxlang as an international lexicon plus a barebones set of postpositions to organize basic sentences.

name should be something like
International Common Lexicon
Dunia Putong Loga
Dupulo?

it's like scientific names for everything
but not just based on Latin
and much much easier to remember and to pronounce
