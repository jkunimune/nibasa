## Proper names

Proper names of countries are re-spelled in Nibasa's alphabet.
Personal names and city names will inevitably be spelled irregularly in many circumstances.
Proper names have access to the bonus letters.
They must be followd by a common noun to identify them (e.g. Franse desa, Suahili basa, Smith jen, Jorje raja, Zamenhof dotor)

## on verbs

in general, I beleve that descriptions like this are an unnecessary and inefficient way to learn a language.  however, since I know the language nerds here will be interested, here is a precise linguistic description of the aspect particles and thematic roles in Nibasa.

in Nibasa, there are a handful of postpositions that can be used to mark the arguments of a sentence.  when a verb is transitive, the agent is he subject (markd with **ga**), and the patient is the direct object (markd with **ro**).  for emotions like happiness and anger, the experiencer is the patient and the stimulus is the agent, tho note that opinions and senses like hatred and vision are not considerd emotions.

aside from subjects and direct objects, postpositions are fairly loose in Nibasa.  the intention is that speakers will use whatever postposition feels most natural to them, which will lead to a good deal of variation.  this is acceptable as long as it does not impact intelligibility.  some examples of common variations:

| english | bil cei 1 | bil cei 2 |
| go to school | darse kan ro gou | darse kan do gou |
| give it to me | mi na don | mi do don |
| explain it to me | mi na ming fa | mi do ming fa |
| near the city | siti di karibu | siti ze karibu |

in Nibasa, an unmarked verb is, depending on its semantics, either a state (such as **blu**, which means "to be blue"), a perfective action (like **yam**, which means "to eat"), or an ambiguous combination of the two (like **furi**, which means "to be angry" or "to anger").  "ta" can emphasize that a state is stative, or force an ambiguous verb to be unambiguously stative.  "fa" can emphasize that an action is perfective or force an ambiguous verb to be perfective.  thus, "furi ta" means "to be angry" and "furi fa" means "to anger".

"ta" can also be added to a semantic action, or to a verb phrase that already has "fa", to convert it to an imperfective action.  for example, "yam ta" means "to be eating", and "blu fa ta" means "to be turning blue".  analagously, "fa" can be added to a semantic state or to a verb phrase that already has "ta" to convert it to a perfective aspect, which corresponds to the causative incohative of the state.  so "blu fa" means "to turn blue" and "yam ta fa" means "to turn into something that is eating" ("ta fa" is not really useful in practice).

there also exist three tense suffixes.  the most useful by far is "le", as it changes an action into an ambiguous combination of stative (the result of the action) and perfective (the action, but in the past), which can again be enforced by adding "ta" or "fa".  "le ta" thus functions as the opposite of "fa" in certain situations.

these particles also interact with the transitivity of verbs.  a state is always intransitive, and its one argument may only be markd by "ga".  a perfective action or an imperfective action, is ambitransitive.  if it has two arguments, "ga" marks the agent and "ro" marks the patient.  if it has one argument markd by "ro", it is the patient.  if it has one argument markd by "ga", it could be the agent or the patient -- whichever is more likely given the semantics of the verb.  note that this makes it impossible to include an agent without including a patient; the phrase "cei ro" is typically inserted when the patient is unknown or unimportant.

| loga | ding mana | varati | use |
|------|-----------|--------|-----|
| ta   | state, -ity   | imperfective | turns a perfective action into an imperfective action or adds emphasis to a state |
| fa   | action, -tion | perfective   | turns a state into an incohative action or adds emphasis to a perfective action |
| le   | done          | past/perfect |turns a state into an experiential state or a perfective action into its resulting state
| zai  | current       | present      | moves the reference time to the present moment |
| ???  | future        | future       | turns a state into a prospective state or perfective action into a prospective action |

this assumes that every verb is semantically either a state (blue), a perfective action (eat), or an ambiguous combination of the two (anger).

there is no passivizer in Nibasa.  if it turns out to be necessary, I will introduce one -- probably "se", or maybe "get".
but for now, I think reversing the order of the arguments should accomplish the same thing more simply.

# on the spelling of /w/

the following table shows the use of the four relevant graphemes in Pandunia's source languages.

| basha           | ⟨v⟩ di valu  | ⟨w⟩ di valu  |
| english         |      v      |      w      |
| espanya         |     b~β     |      w*     |
| franse          |      v      |      w*     |
| turki           |      v      |      v*     |
| suahili         |      v      |      w      |
| malayu          |      v      |      w      |
| viete           |      v      |             |
| putong han      |             |      w      |
| nipon (roma zi) |      v*     |      w      |
| rus (roma zi)   |      v      |             |
| arabi (roma zi) |             |      w      |
| hindi (roma zi) |      ʋ      |             |
| cosen (roma zi) |             |      w      |

| basha           | ⟨v⟩ di use | ⟨w⟩ di use |
| helen (roma zi) | absent     | absent     |
| latin           | common     | absent     |
| english         | common     | common     |
| arabi (roma zi) | absent     | common     |
| sanskrita (roma zi) | common (sometimes \[w\]) | absent     |
| han             | absent     | common     |

the goal is to make words as recognizable as possible.  that means matching native spellings as closely as possible when those native spellings are in the Latin alphabet.  to simplify the situation, we can look at the four main sources of Nibasa vocabulary.  we can prioritize languages that use the Latin alphabet.

between v and w, the choice is clear.
- Latin-influenced languages exclusively uses ⟨v⟩.
- the Arabic language uses /w/, but doesn't use the Latin alphabet.  when Arabic words are spelld with the Latin alphabet in Turkish and Swahili, they tend to use both ⟨v⟩ and ⟨w⟩ respectively.
- Middle Chinese has /w/, which is spelld ⟨w⟩ in most Chinese-influenced langauges, but none of them use the Latin alphabet as their primary script.
- Sanskrit languages tend to use both \[v\] and \[w\] as variations on /ʋ/, but don't use the Latin alphabet.


# other stuff

hello, I'm the scientific advisor to the new country of Hopeland (soon to be calld Nidesa).
subsequent to my primary policy goals of promoting nuclear energy and the new decimal time system, I am constructing a language for use in Hopeland.
it will be based primarily on Pandunia, but I want to comb thru the grammar, comparing it against that of Lidepla and Globasa for any good ideas.

tese | eng:thesis, por:tese, spa:may:tesis, fra:thèse, deu:These, rus:те́зис (tézis), tur:tez, ara:, fas:تز (tez), jpn:テーゼ (tēze), kor:테제 (teje) + swa:utetezi
alkasus, alkol, alkali -> kasus, kohol, kali
bucha -> buchar (check transcription of "-er")
gomu -> kauchu
klien -> kek
kave, tolera, rezerve -> kava, toler, rezerva
tong -> tung
hogo sanduku -> foto sanduku
minor -> legu
an zai -> hin
astatin -> astate
redi -> junbei
dokumen, restorante, hidrargente -> dokum, restoran, hidrargen
zou -> zo
zoku -> zuka
Koran -> Quran
lin -> liny to make room for lin=neighbor
lanca -> jeta to make room for lance
pulse could actually be better than darbe?

one simple root dictionary, organized by lexical category
one printed dictionary
one printed textbook
one printed light learning book (with basic words, examples, useful phrases, and a small glossary)
book of word puzzles

cut off all unnecessary letters; words that end in consonants are a-ok and will help reduce hiatus

the suffixes *ce*, *jen*, *gu*, *fa*, and *te* are often left out when the context is clear, much like in English:
- *mural*, short for *mural art*
- *tele-fon*, short for *tele-fon-macin*

English relative clauses restrict several useful formations:
putting a prepositional phrase before the part of the sentence with the relative pronoun
	You're talking about what it returns if you call "typeof" on it.
	\*You're talking about, if you call "typeof" on it, what it returns.
	You're talking about, if you call "typeof" on it, what does it return.
just relative clauses where you have a circumpositional idiom
	That's the barn that more cats have been born in the back of it than most vetrinary clinics in this country.
	That's the barn in the back of which which more cats have been born than in most vetrinary clinics in this country. (awkward)
it's confusing questions are different from subordinate interrogative clauses
	I don't know whether that is important.
	Is that important?
it's confusing how point of comparison is not always next to the comparative
	I eat more beans than most peeple.
	\*I eat more than most peeple beans.

it's much easier to pay attention to the semantic components of content words than to the orders of function words.
it's better to have a few content words with a clear structure than to make peeple understand the difference between nun le and le nun.
that's why the core philosophy of Nibasa is to minimize the number and functional load of structure words.
every word (besides the postpositions) has a tangible meaning, and their order doesn't matter much beyond with what other words they are associated.

no word class markers, including -to and -e.
many auxlangs struggle to balance three desirable features:
lack of mandatory grammatical marking, clear sentence structure, and loose word class.
I contend that a strictly head-final language is the solution.

the lessons should not have words like "jussive".
the reference grammar should not have words like "exhortation"

don't tell the reader about every possible combination of funccion words, and definitely don't blend them into single words.
just tell them useful phrases as they come up, and let the transparent grammar speak for itself.


any postposition can be omitted.
ro and di most commonly.
ga usually does change how the sentence is parsd.

the truncated morphemes are a sine that you are trying to pack too much information into each word for a language that is ostensibly isolating.

Nibasa reimagines the auxlang as an international lexicon plus a barebones set of postpositions to organize basic sentences.

name should be something like
International Common Lexicon
Dunia Putong Loga
Dupulo?

it's like scientific names for everything
but not just based on Latin
and much much easier to remember and to pronounce

DPL is fully functional as a spoken language.
While it does not have the large speaker base of a natural language,
and therefore does not have immediate practical value or a large body of literature,
there are still reasons you might want to learn to speak it.

compounds may be adopted as roots in Nibasa, but only if
1. the compound itself is internationally used, not just the components
2. neither component of the compound is itself a Nibasa root, and
3. neither component already summarizes the meaning of the compound (e.g. the 学 in 学習)

these rules can be suspended if the compound is extremely international and there is no recourse (such as *ramen*).
also, "im-" and "kom-" are fine because they're not usually transparent enuff to cause confusion.

should forward be fronte or pro?
definitely fronte.  peeple will think "pro" means "in favor" or "professional";
even if some of the "pro-" compounds still make sense, they're not transparent.

all sentence-level things should go after the verb.  tenses, aspects, negation, and moods.  just for consistency's sake.
placing a **no** before the verb indicates that you are negating specifically the verb rather than the whole sentence.

productive suffixes should never use hyphens.
but suffixes with vague and semantically variable meanings should never be productive and should generally take hyphens
-kan
-jen
-gu
-makin
 le
 fa
 ta

don't mention tenses at all to learners.  it will just confuse them.
teach past tense at some point, teach progressive aspect another time, and that's enuff.

check consistency in Taino -oa (barbakoa, kanoa)

I need a better name.  with what words do I have to work?
- universal (putong)
- earth (geo)
- global (dunia)
- international (nasia-medi (could be inter-nasia))
- human (insan)
- simple (simple)
- standard (norma)
- lexicon (loga-jama)

global stanardized lexicon (dunol)?
international simplified lexicon (nasil)?


- there is no definite article **la** (all nouns are markd by postpositions (tho maybe I should use **al** for this anyway)).
- there is no relative pronoun **jo** or content clause marker **ki** (both are indicated by **di**).
- there is no possessive preposition **da** (only the postposition **di** is needed).
- there is no passive auxiliary **be** (the subject and object are marked with postpositions, so they can be swapd around freely).

in addition, many words that were necessarily function words in Pandunia 2.0 are effectively content words in Nibasa, so you don't need to know their part of speech to parse a sentence.  this includes
- pronouns **mi**, **tu**, and **ye**, which are just normal nouns (**se** merges with **auto**)
- demonstratives **ni**, **go**, **yo**, and **ke**, and quantifiers **un**, **yo**, **eni**, **pan**, which are just adjectives that can also function as nouns (**poli** merges with **ba**)
- auxiliary verbs **si**, **fa**, which are just normal verbs as well as common suffixes (**si** merges with **ta** and **fa** merges with **karma**).

subordinate clauses, be they relative or otherwise, must always be followed by "di" and then a content word.

# hyperspecific transcription notes

country names should be stripped to whatever minimum root is present in both the country name, language name, and people name.
in some cases that will include a root that means "land", like "island" or "osteraih", and that's okay.  but keep "ia" if it has one.  not if it's just in the nisba adjective tho; nisba adjectives don't count for "ia".
