## Proper names

Proper names of countries are re-spelled in Nibasa's alphabet.
Personal names and city names will inevitably be spelled irregularly in many circumstances.
Proper names have access to the bonus letters.
They must be followd by a common noun to identify them (e.g. Franse desa, Suahili basa, Smith jen, Jorje raja, Zamenhof dotor)

## on verbs

in general, I beleve that descriptions like this are an unnecessary and inefficient way to learn a language.  however, since I know the language nerds here will be interested, here is a precise linguistic description of the aspect particles and thematic roles in Nibasa.

in Nibasa, there are a handful of postpositions that can be used to mark the arguments of a sentence.  when a verb is transitive, the agent is the subject (markd with **ga**), and the patient is the direct object (markd with **ro**).  for emotions like happiness and anger, the experiencer is the patient and the stimulus is the agent, tho note that opinions and senses like hatred and vision are not considerd emotions.

aside from subjects and direct objects, postpositions are fairly loose in Nibasa.  the intention is that speakers will use whatever postposition feels most natural to them, which will lead to a good deal of variation.  this is acceptable as long as it does not impact intelligibility.  some examples of common variations:

| english | bil cei 1 | bil cei 2 |
| go to school | darse kan ro gou | darse kan do gou |
| give it to me | mi na don | mi do don |
| explain it to me | mi na ming fa | mi do ming fa |
| near the city | siti di karibu | siti ze karibu |

in Nibasa, an unmarked verb is, depending on its semantics, either a state (such as **blu**, which means "to be blue"), a perfective action (like **yam**, which means "to eat"), or an ambiguous combination of the two (like **furi**, which means "to be angry" or "to anger").  "ta" can emphasize that a state is stative, or force an ambiguous verb to be unambiguously stative.  "fa" can emphasize that an action is perfective or force an ambiguous verb to be perfective.  thus, "furi ta" means "to be angry" and "furi fa" means "to get angry".

"ta" can also be added to a semantic action, or to a verb phrase that already has "fa", to convert it to an imperfective action.  for example, "yam ta" means "to be eating", and "blu fa ta" means "to be turning blue".  analagously, "fa" can be added to a semantic state or to a verb phrase that already has "ta" to convert it to a perfective aspect, which corresponds to the causative incohative of the state.  so "blu fa" means "to turn blue" and "yam ta fa" means "to turn into something that is eating" ("ta fa" is not really useful in practice).

there also exist three tense suffixes.  the most useful by far is "le", as it changes an action into an ambiguous combination of stative (the result of the action) and perfective (the action, but in the past), which can again be enforced by adding "ta" or "fa".  "le ta" thus functions as the opposite of "fa" in certain situations.

these particles also interact with the transitivity of verbs.  a state is always intransitive, and its one argument may only be markd by "ga".  a perfective action or an imperfective action, is ambitransitive.  if it has two arguments, "ga" marks the agent and "ro" marks the patient.  if it has one argument markd by "ro", it is the patient.  if it has one argument markd by "ga", it could be the agent or the patient -- whichever is more likely given the semantics of the verb.  note that this makes it impossible to include an agent without including a patient; the phrase "cei ro" is typically inserted when the patient is unknown or unimportant.

| loga | ding mana | varati | use |
|------|-----------|--------|-----|
| ta   | state, -ity   | imperfective | turns a perfective action into an imperfective action or adds emphasis to a state |
| fa   | action, -tion | perfective   | turns a state into an incohative action or adds emphasis to a perfective action |
| le   | done          | past/perfect |turns a state into an experiential state or a perfective action into its resulting state
| zai  | current       | present      | moves the reference time to the present moment |
| ???  | future        | future       | turns a state into a prospective state or perfective action into a prospective action |

this assumes that every verb is semantically either a state (blue), a perfective action (eat), or an ambiguous combination of the two (anger).

there is no passivizer in Nibasa.  if it turns out to be necessary, I will introduce one -- probably "se", or maybe "get".
but for now, I think reversing the order of the arguments should accomplish the same thing more simply.

I wonder if it would be better to try active/stative alinement.  I would haff to change "ga" and "ro", since those are sourced pretty nominative-acusatively.  I wonder if I could so something clever like "fi" for agent and "ti" for patient, from "fa" and "ta".

# on the spelling of /w/

the following table shows the use of the four relevant graphemes in Pandunia's source languages.

| basha           | ⟨v⟩ di valu  | ⟨w⟩ di valu  |
| english         |      v      |      w      |
| espanya         |     b~β     |             |
| franse          |      v      |             |
| turki           |      v      |             |
| suahili         |      v      |      w      |
| malayu          |      v      |      w      |
| viete           |      v      |             |
| putong han      |             |      w      |
| nipon (roma zi) |      v*     |      w      |
| rus (roma zi)   |      v      |             |
| arabi (roma zi) |             |      w      |
| hindi (roma zi) |      ʋ      |             |
| cosen (roma zi) |             |      w      |

| basha           | ⟨v⟩ di use | ⟨w⟩ di use |
| helen (roma zi) | absent     | absent     |
| latin           | common     | absent     |
| english         | common     | common     |
| arabi (roma zi) | absent     | common     |
| sanskrita (roma zi) | common (sometimes \[w\]) | absent     |
| han             | absent     | common     |

the goal is to make words as recognizable as possible.  that means matching native spellings as closely as possible when those native spellings are in the Latin alphabet.  to simplify the situation, we can look at the four main sources of Nibasa vocabulary.  we can prioritize languages that use the Latin alphabet.

between v and w, the choice is clear.
- Latin-influenced languages exclusively uses ⟨v⟩.
- the Arabic language uses /w/, but doesn't use the Latin alphabet.  when Arabic words are spelld with the Latin alphabet in Turkish and Swahili, they tend to use both ⟨v⟩ and ⟨w⟩ respectively.
- Middle Chinese has /w/, which is spelld ⟨w⟩ in most Chinese-influenced languages, but none of them use the Latin alphabet as their primary script.
- Sanskrit languages tend to use both \[v\] and \[w\] as variations on /ʋ/, but don't use the Latin alphabet.

Let's look at some specific examples.  of words that start with v:
- "waha", "waraka", and "waris" could go either way but are probably better with "w"
- "wik", "wakcop", "widou", "wan-gu", "wancen", "wei", and "Wikipedia" are better with "w"
- "waksina", "wale", "walu", "wampir", "wandal", "wegeta", "wende", "wersi", "wioleta", "wise", "wiza", "tele-wizi", "woto", and "woze" are all better with "v"

It's tuff because there is a limit to how much you can change a word and have people still intuitively recognize it, and I feel like this crosses that line.


# needed suffixen

I lack a good collective suffix.  something to make knowledge -> lore, island -> archipelago, Christian -> Christendom, text -> literature, human -> humanity, client -> clientelle, leaf -> folliage


# other stuff

English relative clauses restrict several useful formations:
putting a prepositional phrase before the part of the sentence with the relative pronoun
	You're talking about what it returns if you call "typeof" on it.
	\*You're talking about, if you call "typeof" on it, what it returns.
	You're talking about, if you call "typeof" on it, what does it return.
just relative clauses where you have a circumpositional idiom
	That's the barn that more cats have been born in the back of it than most vetrinary clinics in this country.
	That's the barn in the back of which which more cats have been born than in most vetrinary clinics in this country. (awkward)
it's confusing questions are different from subordinate interrogative clauses
	I don't know whether that is important.
	Is that important?
it's confusing how point of comparison is not always next to the comparative
	I eat more beans than most peeple.
	\*I eat more than most peeple beans.

it's much easier to pay attention to the semantic components of content words than to the orders of function words.
it's better to have a few content words with a clear structure than to make peeple understand the difference between nun le and le nun.
that's why the core philosophy of Nibasa is to minimize the number and functional load of structure words.
every word (besides the postpositions) has a tangible meaning, and their order doesn't matter much beyond with what other words they are associated.

no word class markers, including -to and -e.
many auxlangs struggle to balance three desirable features:
lack of mandatory grammatical marking, clear sentence structure, and loose word class.
I contend that a strictly head-final language is the solution.

the lessons should not have words like "jussive".
the reference grammar should not have words like "exhortation"

don't tell the reader about every possible combination of funccion words, and definitely don't blend them into single words.
just tell them useful phrases as they come up, and let the transparent grammar speak for itself.


any postposition can be omitted.
ro and di most commonly.
ga usually does change how the sentence is parsd.

the truncated morphemes are a sine that you are trying to pack too much information into each word for a language that is ostensibly isolating.

Nibasa reimagines the auxlang as an international lexicon plus a barebones set of postpositions to organize basic sentences.

name should be something like
International Common Lexicon
Dunia Putong Loga
Dupulo?

it's like scientific names for everything
but not just based on Latin
and much much easier to remember and to pronounce

DPL is fully functional as a spoken language.
While it does not have the large speaker base of a natural language,
and therefore does not have immediate practical value or a large body of literature,
there are still reasons you might want to learn to speak it.

compounds may be adopted as roots in Nibasa, but only if
1. the compound itself is internationally used, not just the components, and
2. neither component of the compound is itself a Nibasa root.

"im-" and "kom-" are fine because they're not usually transparent enuff to cause confusion.

should forward be fronte or pro?
definitely fronte.  peeple will think "pro" means "in favor" or "professional";
even if some of the "pro-" compounds still make sense, they're not transparent.

all sentence-level things should go after the verb.  tenses, aspects, negation, and moods.  just for consistency's sake.
placing a **no** before the verb indicates that you are negating specifically the verb rather than the whole sentence.

productive suffixes should never use hyphens.
but suffixes with vague and semantically variable meanings should never be productive and should generally take hyphens
-kan
-jen
-gu
-makin
 le
 fa
 ta

don't mention tenses at all to learners.  it will just confuse them.
teach past tense at some point, teach progressive aspect another time, and that's enuff.

check consistency in Taino -oa (barbakoa, kanoa)

I need a better name.  with what words do I have to work?
- universal (putong)
- earth (geo)
- global (dunia)
- international (nasia-medi (could be inter-nasia))
- human (insan)
- simple (simple)
- standard (norma)
- lexicon (loga-jama)

global stanardized lexicon (dunol)?
international simplified lexicon (nasil)?

sinitic words should usually be two-characters, unless they're a suffix.
but they follow the same compound rules.  so we don't use 終了 (jungliao) because 了 (liao) is already used as a suffix.
feminine nisba adjectives don't count as -ia, so don't use them like that


- there is no definite article **la** (all nouns are markd by postpositions (tho maybe I should use **al** for this anyway)).
- there is no relative pronoun **jo** or content clause marker **ki** (both are indicated by **di**).
- there is no possessive preposition **da** (only the postposition **di** is needed).
- there is no passive auxiliary **be** (the subject and object are marked with postpositions, so they can be swapd around freely).

in addition, many words that were necessarily function words in Pandunia 2.0 are effectively content words in Nibasa, so you don't need to know their part of speech to parse a sentence.  this includes
- pronouns **mi**, **tu**, and **ye**, which are just normal nouns (**se** merges with **aoto**)
- demonstratives **ni**, **go**, **yo**, and **ke**, and quantifiers **un**, **yo**, **eni**, **pan**, which are just adjectives that can also function as nouns (**poli** merges with **ba**)
- auxiliary verbs **si**, **fa**, which are just normal verbs as well as common suffixes (**si** merges with **ta** and **fa** merges with **karma**).

subordinate clauses, be they relative or otherwise, must always be followed by "di" and then a content word.

# family words

every family word can be expressed by the following pattern:
  /(fem|mac)? (sangue|adopta|gami|lao|joven)?-(cin|mama|baba)\*-(kak)\*-(ben)\*/

the last three parts dictate the nature of the relation.  "cin", "mama", or "baba" moves up one generation,
"kak" moves across one level of cosanguinity, and "ben" moves down one generation.
"cin"/"mama"/"baba" are never used in the same term as "ben" (they cancel out to make a "kak").
"mama" and "baba" are also never used in the same term as "cin" or "kak" (such terms must be expanded to phrases or left genderless).
"fem" and "mac" are never used with "mama"/"baba" because that would be redundant.
we exclude "fem cin" and "nam cin" because those have dedicated roots.


# I think I need a causative suffix separate from the hortative suffix

changing the verbal arguments doesn’t work well for ditransitive verbs

know -> inform/find out
marifa -> marifa-fa

eat -> feed


# I've been thinking of VSO

I think it's easier to understand head-initial languages because whenever you hear a word you already know its part of speech and role in the sentence, but that's not backd up by evidence as far as I know.  I could check.

it would also allow English-like prepositions.  the only trick is I would need to find one for the patient (I can use "bai" and "tu" for agent and theme).  maybe "da" from "the"?

in terms of word bilding:
- head-initial would work better for arabic prefixes m-, mu, and ibn, swahili prefixes mwana-, u-, and m-, english prepositions _from_, _of_, and maybe _en_ and _tu_, english prefixes _un-_ and _non-_ and _not_ and _get_ and _make/turn_; plus I could use _dat_ for introducing subordinate clauses.
- head-final would work better for persian suffix -kan, and latin suffix -logi, -plika, and chinese suffixen -du
- latin directionals re-, es-, in-, and frends would work fine either way

the main issue is that -fa, -ta, -kan, and varius other suffixes are based on natlang suffixes, so I would probably need to find alternatives that would be good prefixes.  maybe ma- for place from Arabic (note it would be more general than -kan, which is only for bildings).  maybe get- for change and bi- for state???  at least re- and es- and in- and al. would still work as prefixes.

what if I get the best of both worlds by simply abandoning the precept of pure head direction?  I can have VSO and prepositions, with adjectives before nouns and keep my suffixes.  I gess the place where it gets hairy is relative clauses, subordinate clauses, and compound verbs.  but to first order, I think I should be able to make something similar to Mandarin work.  I should try to learn Tagalog, which seems like it does this.  if I like it and it seems like it would work for my use case, I'll take that.

hmmm, I somehow only just noticed that the topic can't come at the start of the sentence in VSO unless you front the subject, which may be weerd.  Hawaiian seems to front the subject in some cases – I'm looking at the Hawaiian Wikipedia article for Hawaiian, which starts "ʻO ka ʻōlelo Hawai′i — ua mea ʻōlelo makuahine a ka poʻe maoli o ka pae moku o Hawaiʻi".  am I willing to allow subject fronting?  seems a slippery slope toward speakers leaving out the pause or fronting the subject in every sentence.  maybe that's paranoia.  if I just teach peeple the unmarkd word order it's unlikely they'll start doing it on their own, but it should still be easy for them to understand the fronted word order.  wow, this Wikipedia is not very active at all.

# stress?

I think I should change the strees rules to stop making i and u into glides, and also allow ny and maybe ly and sy as initial consonant clusters (but def not ty or ky).  this would change the stress of -ia words to be on the i, but after studying arabic and swahili (and spanish to a lesser extent), that feels a lot less weird to me.  it would also move the stress on -iu words, which is more problematic; I might drop the u then.

Well, I should keep ai, au, oi, ei, and ou as monosyllables because that covers some important latin and arabic words.  and chinese words for that matter.  aodi, aoro, braoza, kaisi, and euro and auto to a lesser extent all really aut to be stressed on the first vowel.


# hyphens?

I wonder if I should just drop the hyphens.  like, do peeple really need to know where the morpheme boundaries are?  I'm not so sure.  and doutless some extra hyphens will get added to words like leiden that aren't technically compounds but are derived from compounds.


# articles

I could abandon the precept of no articles and lean more into a hawaiian grammar, in order to avoid making up subject and object prepositions.  tho onestly, given that I'm afraid my language is too similar to english already for something that's not english (a false frend of a language, if you will), using "da" for actual "the" mite make that worse.  and anyway, it's not like hawaiian doesn't have subject and object prepositions.


# compound adjectives

I've gone back and forth in the past over whether it should be "bon-vizi" or "vizi-bon".  but I think I've finally settled on the former.  it makes a much more intuitive noun (because remember, every adjective is also a noun), and it allows me to use "te" and "nai" for "-ful" and "-less" (as suffixes they already mean "-ness" and "not").


# words that are more specific in every language but their originators

kitab
film
manga
anime
rock (’n’ roll)
drink
sake
meeting
soiree
crepe
sombrero
katana
jian?
epee?
darma?
karma?
allah
bazaar

I think in general it's better to use the original meanings.  "bazar" is a good word for "market" should I need it, "drinke" is a great word for drink, and cetera.

# causatives

in Nibasa, "get" indicates an intransitive or passive transitive verb,
while "don" indicates an active transitive verb.
neither is ever necessary.
but do "don" verb phrases mark the target with "li" or "ro"?

auxiliary verbs can also be transitive or intransitive.
adding a transitive auxiliary verb to a transitive content verb creates a ditransitive verb phrase.

sana makes the causative of a verb, and is usually only used for the causatives of transitive verbs (since the causative of an intransitive can effectively be formed with don, tho sana also works.).

in English, we have "make" as a causative and "get" as a passivizer.
in Japanese, "give" can mark a beneficiary, "get" can be a passivizer.
in Hindi, "go" sometimes marks intransitive and "give" sometimes marks transitive.

# au vs ao

I think I should switch to ao.  it works so much better for chinese words, plus kakao and arguably tatao.  the problem children are auto, auro, and audi.  maybe they can just keep being spelled that way?  hmmm, but I do want peeple to be able to predict spelling from pronunciation.  maybe I can change audi to a different root and change auto to zi?  that's not great.  maybe I just suck it up and spell it aotomovi.

# hyperspecific transcription notes

country names should be stripped to whatever minimum root is present in both the country name, language name, and people name.
in some cases that will include a root that means "land", like "island" or "osteraih", and that's okay.  but keep "ia" if it has one.  not if it's just in the nisba adjective tho; nisba adjectives don't count for "ia".

when a cultural term has multiple languages associated with it, use the most widely spoken language (so chinese cities and provinces are generally going to use their mandarin names, tho dishes may use a different name if they're really specificly associated with a different chinese language; Aíti is spelled as it is in French (not Ayiti as it would be in Haitian Creole)).

## Scientific terms

-um -> -o
-ium -> -iu
-ine -> -o
-on (noble gas or particle) -> -on
-on (other) -> -o

## Albanian

ʃ -> c

## Arabic

if a word ends in b, d, D, or gh, append "a"
stress: accute accent
ʃ -> c
names should always be transcribed in standard arabic, except that jiim can be spelled "g" for Egyptian names

## Bantu

g -> g
ng -> ing (but ingurube would be too long...)
intervocalic d -> r
b -> b
mb -> imb
ʊ -> u

## Chinese

stress: unmarked
middle chinese ŋ -> g
well, but it's lost before a yod in cantonese...
words with ŋ include stone, ideology, and jade
middle chinese ɦ -> ◌
mandarin sh -> s, zh -> z, ch -> c

this only applies to basic words, which sample all chinese languages and chinese-adjacent languages.
for cultural terms applying specificly to China, it's better to spell terms as they are in Mandarin,
except that j and x should go to z, g, s, and h as usual (but q -> c always)

## Dutch

ei -> ei
ij -> ei

## English

if a word ends in b, d, or g, append "e"
place names that come from languages outside english should be spelld with the same vowel letters as in english, if that brings it closer to the etymological pronunciation.
stress: accute accent
sh -> c
th -> th no matter voicing
plural marker -> keep
north/south/east/west -> translated
